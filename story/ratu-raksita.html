                                    even special magic. But of course, great power comes with great responsibility. When

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This story is about a young lady named Celia B&#39;flies. She
                                    was gifted with the
                                    power to communicate and control butterflies. Just like a butterfly, she was
                                    gorgeous. She moved to the
                                    townsite, so she needed this person to help her. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Excuse me, do you know where van Fyr&#39;s house
                                    is?&quot; Celia asked a
                                    florist in the town.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, it is over there, young lady. Just go straight
                                    until the end of the road.
                                    It&#39;s near the bridge on the right side,&quot; the florist pointed at a long
                                    road, making Celia sweat
                                    already.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, thank you very much, sir. By the way, your
                                    flowers are very beautiful.
                                    Have a nice day!&quot; Celia said with her bright smile and started to walk
                                    again.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The florist was really happy to hear Celia&rsquo;s compliment
                                    that it made every
                                    flower in his store bloom perfectly. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one said it was a long road to get to van Fyr&#39;s
                                    house.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, come on, I&#39;m in a hurry to complete my house.
                                    Where is it?&quot; Celia
                                    was worried because the sun had leaned to the west already. &quot;Oh, there&#39;s
                                    the bridge!&quot; Celia
                                    ran as fast as she could to the only house near the bridge. She was very happy that
                                    finally, she found the
                                    house. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Excuse me.&quot; Celia knocked on the door of a simple
                                    house that she believed
                                    belonged to van Fyr.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes?&quot; A sound came from the other side of the
                                    door. The door then opened,
                                    and a man came out with a casual look. He just woke up, that was what Celia
                                    thought.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hi! My name is Celia B&#39;flie, and I&#39;m looking
                                    for van Fyr&#39;s house.
                                    Is this the right address?&quot; Celia asked with her smile. As usual, she hoped she
                                    didn&#39;t need to
                                    search over the town anymore.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What do you want?&#39;&#39; His tone was quite
                                    unfriendly, it made Celia a bit
                                    uncomfortable, but she needed him.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I just moved to the townsite, and I need your
                                    help to light up my
                                    house.&quot; Celia tried to explain her intention with a worried face. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I can&#39;t. Just ask Luci&eacute;r or Mr. Lyn to light
                                    your
                                    house.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Celia couldn&#39;t believe it. After all her efforts to find
                                    van Fyr&#39;s house, all
                                    she got was rejection.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Uhm, no, I can control butterflies just like
                                    Luci&eacute;r controls her
                                    fireflies, and I know she doesn&#39;t like her babies trapped. And about Mr. Lyn,
                                    uhh... I can&#39;t stand
                                    Mrs. Torden&#39;s noise. So, all I have is you.&quot; Celia tried to convince that
                                    man to help her with all
                                    her reasoning.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man then sighs, &quot;you know the last time I tried to
                                    light someone&#39;s
                                    house, I almost burned Mr. Chopsticks&#39; house.&quot; </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, this was surprising news for Celia. You could see
                                    doubt and fear in her
                                    face. But no, Celia couldn&#39;t ask someone else for this. &quot;But I&#39;m sure
                                    you can do it cleanly for
                                    now.&quot; Celia still tries to trust the man, &quot;please, please, only you can
                                    help me for now.&quot; Her
                                    blinking eyes once again began begging to van Fyr. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a heavy breath, the man then said, &quot;okay, but
                                    don&#39;t blame me if a fire
                                    starts to burn your house.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He opened the door and let Celia go into his house. Of
                                    course, Celia was very happy
                                    right now.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you, Mr. van Fyr,&quot; Celia smiled brightly
                                    with a radiant face.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Brian, just call me Brian,&quot; he said while packing
                                    his things.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, Celia could only smile and look at her surroundings.
                                    It was a neat minimalist
                                    house with white and orange tones dominating the room, making the room feel warm.
                                    Yet the room was quiet for
                                    a medium house. Celia believed Brian lived alone in this house. That made Celia a
                                    bit concerned.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m done. Are you ready?&quot; Brian asked her as
                                    he brought a backpack on
                                    his shoulder.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, let&#39;s go before it gets dark.&quot; Celia
                                    quickly got up, and their
                                    trip to Celia&#39;s house began.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Along the way, Celia took the lead and walked a bit fast
                                    while Brian followed right
                                    behind her. On their way through the town, Celia was greeted by several people she
                                    knew, and Brian remained
                                    silent. That made Celia curious why it seemed like Brian was not part of the town.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After getting to the quiet road, Celia starts to talk.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Brian, can I ask you a question?&quot; Celia looked at
                                    him and aligned their
                                    steps together. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Go ahead,&quot; but Brian looked not interested in their
                                    talk.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Back in the town, why did no one greet you? Isn&#39;t
                                    your power pretty useful
                                    to help them?&quot; Celia finally let out her curiosity.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, they hate me. My power is indeed useful, but if
                                    only I do it right. No
                                    one will trust someone who makes a mistake.&quot; He says flatly without any
                                    expression. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is it also the reason why you live far away from the
                                    town?&quot; Celia asked
                                    again. She felt bad for what happened to Brian.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I remember you only wanted to ask a question.&quot;
                                    That answer is enough to
                                    make Celia upset.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, come on, I try to be friendly here,&quot; Celia
                                    pretended to sulk, making
                                    Brian smile slightly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Technically, yes, they are afraid I would burn their
                                    house, and I don&#39;t
                                    want to make them uncomfortable with me being around. So, I decided to live a bit
                                    far from town,&quot; Brian
                                    explained all Celia wanted to know.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m very sorry to hear that. It must be hard for
                                    you.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You could see how concerned Celia was after she knew things
                                    about Brian&#39;s
                                    life.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Not really. I&#39;m getting used to it.&quot;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, Celia ready to take her words back. This man, what can
                                    I say about him?
                                    Ignorant, yes, that might be the right word for him. An ignorant man that could make
                                    Celia pretty upset that
                                    time.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sometimes, I think I shouldn&#39;t have worried about
                                    someone ignorant,&quot;
                                    Celia sighed, that brought Brian&#39;s tiny laugh.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah, you shouldn&#39;t. Someone worries too much about
                                    little things. Others
                                    might think it&#39;s unnecessary.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Again, Celia doesn&#39;t understand how Brian&#39;s head
                                    works.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you know that I talked about you?&quot; asked
                                    Celia.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, and I talked about you.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Celia might have become mad, so she quickly walked away and
                                    left Brian with his
                                    smiles. He likes to tease her. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their trip had come to an end. Celia and Brian were about to
                                    arrive at Celia&#39;s
                                    house after passing the pond. But it was already sunset, and what Celia had been
                                    worried about had come
                                    true.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey there, sweetie, what do you have here?&quot; A low
                                    voice comes from behind
                                    the trees.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We have nothing, so please leave us alone,&quot; Celia
                                    answered with her voice
                                    full of fear. Brian saw their surroundings and looked for any possibilities an
                                    attack would come.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Brian, we need to run,&quot; Celia whispers to Brian
                                    after a butterfly comes to
                                    her, &quot;my kids said it&#39;s Grenouille, one of the thugs. I heard that he would
                                    take anything from
                                    anyone he saw,&quot; Celia explained with her trembling voice still at low volume.
                                    Brian was a bit worried
                                    to hear about that. He was worried that it would be dangerous for Celia.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, you go first, and I&#39;ll watch your
                                    back,&quot; even though he was
                                    ignorant, Brian was a gentleman who would protect women. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Okay, on the count of three. One&hellip; two&hellip;
                                    thre-&#39;&#39; before
                                    Celia finished her count, a lasso rope wrapped around her body, and a man came out
                                    from the trees.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, well, look what we got here. A fine young lady.
                                    Of course, you don&#39;t
                                    mind having fun with a cool guy like me, right?&quot; Celia was right. It was
                                    Grenouille.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c4">Grenouille always catches his prey with his special lasso
                                    rope, </span><span class="c4">spiriat</span><span class="c0">. It was a special tool
                                    he had which could grip anything because
                                    of its adhesive power. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Brian, run!&quot; Celia shouted in pain because
                                    Grenouille&#39;s spiriat
                                    started crushing her body.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, you have a guy over there,&quot; shouted
                                    Grenouille, &quot;hey dude! You
                                    better listen to her words and run if you don&#39;t want to get hurt. So I can have
                                    a good time with this
                                    girl.&quot; That&#39;s disgusting for Celia, but she couldn&#39;t do
                                    anything.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, I won&#39;t,&quot; said Brian cleary.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He started to light up and burn everything in front of him.
                                    Everything, except
                                    Celia.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c4">&quot;IT&#39;S HOT!&quot; Grenouille screamed and released
                                    his </span><span class="c4">spiriat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from Celia, then
                                    ran away.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You okay?&quot; Brian ran to Celia with his worried
                                    face and helped her to
                                    stand.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m totally fine. See, I told you that you have
                                    better control of your
                                    flame now,&quot; stated Celia while fixing her appearance.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, that&#39;s a coincidence,&quot; said Brian
                                    hesitantly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You could see it because his head was down while talking to
                                    Celia.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Coincidence? You saved my life. How was that supposed
                                    to be a coincidence? Come
                                    on, be more confident, Mr. van Fyr!&quot; Celia patted Brian&#39;s shoulder and
                                    continued to walk. All Brian
                                    could do was smile, and as Celia walked in front of him, he said, &quot;whatever you
                                    say, miss,&quot; and
                                    started to follow her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, they arrived at Celia&#39;s house, and Brian started
                                    to do his task. Now he
                                    did it clean and neat, just like Celia said. Celia&#39;s house became
                                    perfect.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh my gosh, my house feels very comfy, as I imagine.
                                    It&#39;s all thanks to
                                    you, Brian.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Celia still went around her new house while Brian only sat on
                                    the couch in the living
                                    room. Yes, he had done a very good job this time.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, if you don&#39;t mind, could you stay for dinner.
                                    Just a little present for
                                    helping me,&quot; and Brian accepted Celia&#39;s offer. Of course, he was hungry
                                    after a long trip,
                                    completed his things, and saved Celia. He needed some food.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dinner was delicious. Brian had never thought Celia would
                                    cook this well. And
                                    there Brian stood in front of the window, still having that thought about the
                                    food.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, how was the food? Was that good?&quot; Celia came
                                    from the kitchen after
                                    cleaning some stuff.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Not bad, at least it is edible,&quot; here we go again,
                                    Brian always teasing
                                    Celia.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Say that again, and you will see my hand on your
                                    face.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brian laughed with a big voice.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Anyway, your butterfly here is beautiful.&quot;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brian pointed at a butterfly glass decoration with colorful
                                    wings.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Granny Glaze made it for me before I moved. Here,
                                    I&#39;ll give it to you as a
                                    reminiscence.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Celia took the butterfly and gave it to Brian. It was only
                                    palm-sized but a bit heavy
                                    because it was glass-made.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&#39;t have to, but thank you.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then it became silent for a moment. They were busy with their
                                    thoughts.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey Brian,&quot; said Celia, suddenly with an unusual
                                    tone. It was more
                                    serious. &quot;Do you know that butterflies don&#39;t live a long life?&quot; a
                                    random question came from
                                    Celia. Brian didn&#39;t have any intention to answer. He only listened to her.
                                    &quot;So I need you to do
                                    another favor for me,&quot; said Celia with no smile and cheerful tone. Only Celia
                                    with a gloomy
                                    face.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You always ask more than you say, don&#39;t you?&quot;
                                    Brian tried to light up
                                    the mood, but it didn&#39;t work.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Celia then faced Brian and stepped closer to him. It feels
                                    strange when something
                                    wraps Brian&#39;s body, but it also feels warm and mild.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Celia hugs Brian.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m not supposed to do this, but it feels
                                    right,&quot; Celia tightened her
                                    hug.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Brian was confused. Everything
                                    was so sudden, and his
                                    little head was unable to process all of these.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It is the end of me,&quot; after Celia said that, Brian
                                    was shocked. He knew
                                    exactly what she meant. It&#39;s Celia&#39;s forbidden action.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;But why?&quot; was the only question in Brian&#39;s
                                    mind.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Just like your power, you&#39;re such a warm person yet
                                    very lonely because no
                                    one would come close to fire. I know you deserve better than what you get now. So at
                                    least let me hug you
                                    because it can make everything better,&quot; explained Celia.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a big decision to sacrifice yourself to make someone
                                    feel better. Celia chose
                                    that path. Her soft heart couldn&#39;t leave Brian as he was. After meeting him, she
                                    knew Brian needed
                                    little attention and appreciation.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, take care of my butterfly&hellip; and let&#39;s
                                    meet at another
                                    chance.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Celia released her hug and smiled as sweetly as she could. On
                                    the other side, Brian
                                    stared blankly at the space in front of him.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Brian looked at the glass butterfly Celia gave to him.
                                    Looking back at how Celia
                                    treated him differently from everyone made him overwhelmed with what just
                                    happened.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know if I should be sad or grateful,&quot;
                                    a tear starts flowing
                                    through Brian&#39;s cheek. &quot;If you don&#39;t do this&hellip; it will be the end
                                    of me,&quot; says the
                                    fire who shouldn&#39;t fall for anyone.</span></p>
