                Love isn&rsquo;t supposed to hurt. It isn&rsquo;t supposed to be
                complex, nor unjust. Love is supposed to make someone feel comfortable and free. It should be liberating and
                wonderful. Either it comes from a simple hello, a soft stare, warm hugs, or words of affirmation from the
                ones we truly adore. Those simple actions can make anyone feels butterflies and make their whole day. With
                love, it eventually comes trust, loyalty, and commitment. But that basic foundation of love that keeps
                everything together like house of cards. You remove one and everything falls apart. The falling usually
                comes from issues, doubts, despair, uncertainty and many more. It shows a person where the true path is
                leading, or sometimes it is simply just a wrong signal. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; There once lived a couple living in an apartment in a quiet street of
                Brooklyn. They used to be madly in love with each other and decided to move in together. But after living
                for about 2 years, the spark was slowly gone. They don&rsquo;t feel like sharing each other&#39;s lives and
                feelings anymore. The girl was getting a promotion and was asked to move to Copenhagen, Denmark. While the
                boy was having a very steady job in Manhattan and had no plans to move. They were discussing their plans for
                the future. </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, what do you think?&rdquo; The girl shot a question. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you love this job?&rdquo; The boy asked.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, I do.&rdquo; The girl answered. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I mean, we have everything here. I can afford us. You can stay here with me
                forever and perhaps, find another job here still. But if you do want this, I guess we can find a way.&rdquo;
                The boy explained. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you still love me?&rdquo; The girl asked.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; The boy looked confused.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I asked if you still love me.&rdquo; Stated the girl again.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course I do, babe. What-&ldquo; The boy was caught off guard.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why do I get the feeling this ends with a goodbye?&rdquo; Said the girl,
                softly.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why? What makes you think so? Do you still love me?&rdquo; The boy asked
                sternly.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I do too. But, I feel sad.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be. We will figure it out, love.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, maybe us moving out of here is a good idea.. I mean, getting new
                experiences and a fresh start.&rdquo; Said the girl, unsurely.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Brooklyn anymore?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s not that, it&#39;s just, maybe Copenhagen can be a great place for
                more opportunities. Plus, it&#39;s only us here.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, babe. Living here was our dream, or at least
                mine.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know. And I hope you know that I never want you to give up on yours,
                especially not because of me.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The boy went silent. He was contemplating himself. For him, the future seemed to be
                right now. He loved his job. And even when it comes to their feelings, he still wants her to stay by his
                side because he knows that she is his comfort blanket, and if home is not a place then it would definitely
                be her. They will somehow figure everything out just like they always do, eventually. </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hearing you say that makes me want to though.&rdquo; He smiled softly,</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">They stared and continued reading each other</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The girl was about to cry.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the contrary, the girl was so certain that they would be separated. One because
                there is no way she would let him sacrifice everything just for her and two because of what&rsquo;s been
                going on lately as well. She felt the relationship was slowly drifting apart and that led her to believe
                that it was about time for goodbye, even though it might feel like hell. So when she heard him, she was
                caught off guard. She didn&rsquo;t think that he would actually go with her at all and that made her sad.
                The girl had always been very independent and self-sufficient. Even after having him by her side, she knew
                that people were bound to change and leave anyway. She didn&rsquo;t want to get attached and be too
                heartbroken like she used to be. She knew that the only person she can truly count on is herself. This
                wasn&rsquo;t a wrong mindset at all in this generation. In fact, this was what the majority of young people
                would have when it comes to love and relationships nowadays. Too many issues and betrayal. We are all bound
                to make mistakes. But the question is, what are you willing to do to make it up? How far would you go? How
                much would you sacrifice? All these things remain uncertain. In the end, only action speaks.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you want to go to Copenhagen, I will go with you. Bear with me on this, but
                I don&rsquo;t want to lose you. I would rather lose my job and everything I have except you. This was a hard
                decision for me, but I am willing to give it up because you deserve it.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The girl broke down crying. She couldn&rsquo;t believe his words. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wanted to make things right between us again. But I really don&rsquo;t know
                how. Its either me staying or us separated. And I- I can&rsquo;t think of staying, babe. I hate it here, I
                tried so hard to settle, but it&rsquo;s been really hard. Plus, The headquarters is huge and Denmark is a
                nice country. I looked up everything-&#39;&#39; She continues to cry even more. &ldquo;Are you sure about
                this? Please, the past month has been so blurry that I don&rsquo;t know about our relationship anymore. It
                kills me. I don&rsquo;t know what I did and I don&rsquo;t know what you did to make us feel this way. It
                feels like we are breaking apart slowly and none of us know the cause of it. Especially now that this plan
                exists, it gives me a solution that I am not even sure if I wanted to take. I mean, I wanted to but without
                you- I would break.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know it&#39;s been really hard between us, I know how much we&rsquo;re
                struggling a lot, but I want to make it right. At first, I didn&#39;t think it was possible to move out of
                here and I thought everything was okay. Now that I know you didn&#39;t like it here, there is no reason for
                me not to help you be in a better place and I am going to be there too. In fact, why would I be here and if
                you weren&#39;t in it? What would my life be like if you weren&#39;t there from the beginning? You are
                God&rsquo;s gift for me, for all things I went through, at least there&rsquo;s you in it. You make me a
                better man. I finally realized that a home is not always a place, it could be a person too.&rdquo; The boy
                smiled.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">They hugged each other.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have no idea how much weight has been lifted off of my chest. I thought
                I&rsquo;ll leave, I thought there&rsquo;s nothing left for us, I thought everything that we built together
                has to end, I thought..&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He caressed her cheek and kissed it. He shook his head, &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t. I will
                make sure of it. You just have to trust me wholefully.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you. You are the most wonderful and generous being anyone can truly
                have.&rdquo; She expressed.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know. I am just so great.&rdquo; He replied jokingly.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; She said,</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you too. Always.&rdquo; He said. &ldquo;Promise to stay with me?&rdquo;
            </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The boy and the girl finally moved to Copenhagen
                together. The girl fulfilled her job there and the boy also got his job pretty quickly. They planned on
                settling there for as long as they both wanted. Apparently after staying there for a while, life is great
                again. It only takes a little bit of communication and a tiny magical telepathy for their love to bloom
                again. After all, it was just a false signal. That signal that can potentially break them apart. At last, it
                was sorted out and they have remained together ever since.</span></p>
