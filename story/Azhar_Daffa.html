                Youth, most people said that youth was the most beautiful time they have ever felt in life. Maybe that applied to me too. My youth was filled with both joy and sorrow. With My best friend and my
            first love, I was fortunate to spend my youth with them because I learned the true meaning of life, learned
            many new things, and tried many exciting experiences.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was 35 that time, living my life the way I dreamed. My youth ended almost ten years
            ago, and I started a new life as an adult. I had a food and beverages business that already had branches in
            the country and abroad. A decade was not a short time to do a business; many things must be
            sacrificed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">As an entrepreneur, I met many people. Meeting clients had become a daily habit so
            that my business ran smoothly. But on the 14th day of spring, there was something different from my daily
            life when I was on my way to my destination. There was a voice that was familiar to me. The voice was still
            the same as 15 years ago when I first met her. A woman spoke right behind me:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Damian, is that you ?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I thought we would never meet again.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I was stunned after hearing that voice, and my heart suddenly pounded. I didn&#39;t
            know what was going on in my heart. Anxiety suddenly appeared. I didn&#39;t know who called that because I
            was sure it was the same person I was younger. I slowly looked back and showed how surprised I was to see
            her beautiful face, which was still the same as 15 years ago. It was like bringing back my memories of my
            youth and the first time I met her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c7">(15 years ago)</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">The 20s were a phase where teenagers experienced a period of searching for identity.
            The ups and downs of this phase would provide many valuable lessons in life. There was no guarantee that
            everything would go smoothly. Before that, let me introduce myself. Hi, my name is Damian. I was in my third
            year of college and majoring in literature. Cool teens like me, of course, had friends who were on the same
            frequency as Rolland and Evan. We&#39;ve been friends since we were freshmen. As young people, of course, we
            had the same goals and dreams. Even though we studied literature, we had the same vision and plan of having
            a business together. We went through several trials and errors in building a business. In the first one, we
            opened a shoe reseller business. Still, unfortunately, the distributor of the shoes found out that the three
            of us were just stupid teenagers who had just entered the business world. Our 15 million money was taken
            away by the fraudster, so the business failed miserably. The second we opened a business to help our friends
            work. The business was going so smoothly. Until one day, Rolland did the stupid thing of putting together an
            assignment with precisely the same content as our client. Then our lecturer realized and immediately
            sanctioned Rolland. Since that idiot made a mistake, our reputation was ruined.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Apart from that, my college life was filled with business failures. In that phase of
            my life, I first met someone who made my heart melt. Maybe you&#39;re wondering why I liked her. Okay, let
            me describe it. She&#39;s a very kind and sweet person. She was caring to others, and she was very
            well-spoken. Anyway, she was one of the most admirable women I&#39;ve ever met besides my mother. The first
            meeting with her was at the freshmen event. I was confused about finding a room to use for the event. Amid
            the confusion, she appeared looking for a room as well. Finally, we asked each other, and we got acquainted.
            Her name was Alexandria, usually called Alessa. I know it&#39;s too much information, but the city that I
            admired the most for its beauty and history was the city of Alexandria in Egypt. It&#39;s a coincidence,
            even though the two things were different but equally beautiful.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even though it sounds fun, of course, at that time, many problems arose, whether
            it&#39;s money, love, family, or other issues. Likewise, in my youth, I went through a lot during the
            journey to the process of growing up. Joy and sadness become one. Gained and losing something had become a
            habit in my life. The first obstacle in my life was my family. I was in the middle class; even though I
            could still afford to meet daily needs, I still needed extra money because I had siblings to fulfill their
            needs. Talking about family, I grew up with a father known as a hard worker and a mother known for her
            intelligence.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Even though my parents still adhere to traditional cultures, their minds were open
            when they saw an event without judging either party. Over time, my family had gone through a lot of changes.
            The shocking moment was when my father was fired from his job. This incident changed my family&#39;s life.
            My family&#39;s finances were disrupted, and several things had to be saved. Since then, as I said before, I
            had always created my own business to meet my own needs without asking for money from my parents. Even
            though I failed a lot, the effort would never be vain. I also had a dream of buying something for my sister.
            I would never forget this struggle and continue to be a part of the history of my life.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Next was the most crucial part of my life. This part produced a lot of laughs and
            tears too. Indeed, friendship and love could never be peaceful and without problems. This story started one
            night. At that time, I was approaching Alessa. That night I asked her for a date and got an unexpected
            answer from her. She said yes, of course, it was a joy for me so I told my two friends and they were also
            happy to hear that. Finally, we decided to go to an art museum on Saturday night. The day had arrived. We
            met at the meeting point at a bus stop near the museum. After walking around the museum, we stopped by a
            restaurant that had just opened. The inside dining area had a food product that was unique and easy to make.
            The food sparked a business idea by imitating the model. Then I spoke to Alessa:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;This food is delicious and looks simple when made. Are you thinking the
            same?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, this is very delicious. Why are you suddenly asking that&quot; said
            Alessa.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I have an idea how we can work together to make a business with this food as a
            product.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmm, that&#39;s a good idea.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll have a discussion with Rolland and Evan about this&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I never imagined that I would date and have a good idea to start a new business. The
            next day, my friends and I discussed making a road map for our new business, not to forget that Alessa also
            participated in creating a new business. I was pleased because I believed the business would run
            successfully. We had a long-term plan for this business.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">It had been two years since we had the idea for &#8203;&#8203;this business. We were
            in our final year and working on a thesis. If you are curious about how our business results. The answer was
            entirely satisfactory because our business was running successfully for a student. Targeted marketing that
            is right on target did our business as expected. Business thrives, and my love blossoms like a rose growing
            in spring. Eighteen months before was probably the best moment when I confessed to her that I liked her. If
            we talk about friendship, we had fun because what we dreamed about had come true. Then money was also very
            influential in our friendship. Money made us happy. We enjoyed every second of our time together without
            thinking about when our youth would end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">But my personal happiness was a bit less. Because suddenly, my father had severe
            health problems, so I couldn&#39;t focus on the work I was facing at that time. After all, the family was my
            top priority, no matter what else. I was keeping this a secret from my friends and girlfriend. I didn&#39;t
            want her to bother with my business. I also changed my habits after I came home. I spent time with Alessa,
            but I had to go home early because of my father. I also less interacted with my friends because I was busy
            taking care of my father.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Time passed, and Rolland and Evan seemed to be fed up with me because my behavior so
            far was quite strange. Although my father&#39;s condition had improved, something had changed in me. I was a
            closed person, and I couldn&#39;t improve because there was no improvement if I was here. Finally, the two
            of them confronted me.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Damian, what the hell are you thinking about? Where have you been?&quot; Evan
            said</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere, I just have something to do, and it&#39;s none of
            your business.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;WOW, that&#39;s a rude man. I thought we were friends, and right now, I think
            at this moment, you&#39;re changing a lot more than before. Is there any problem with Roland or
            me?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, I think both of you have a problem, I feel I&#39;m stuck in here, and
            there&#39;s no room for growth. I think this place doesn&#39;t fit me anymore. That&#39;s the
            truth.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;So, do you want to quit after all this time and after we&#39;ve been through?
            We can communicate this problem and solve it together. Why are you so dumb and not telling this thing to us.
            I think you don&#39;t deserve us. I&#39;ll let you quit. I don&#39;t care about you anymore.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Okay, sooner or later, I&#39;ll leave, and I&#39;d like to apologize if it
            makes you all uncomfortable.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Finally, I also decided to leave the business I had built with my friends because of
            different goals and wanted a new experience. It was as if these obstacles persist. I was facing a problem
            with my relationship with Alessa. I had had abysmal communication with her for the past few months. We
            fought and blamed each other when we met. We were already on the verge of breaking up. Communication
            problems and our busy lives make it rare to meet or chat. Finally, one night the silence broke, and we had a
            fight.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you feel this has become a burden for both of us? In the last few months, I
            have been tired of all this. I am tired of dealing with your childishness,&quot; I said.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;You say I&#39;m childish? Don&#39;t you think about what you did? In the last
            few months, you were the cause of all this. You always disappeared for no reason. Does that seem normal to
            all of us? Of course not!!! In this relationship, you always feel the most perfect and never want to be
            blamed. Our two years of friendship felt in vain. You let you down,&quot; replied Alessa.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Okay, let&#39;s finish this right now. If we feel the same way. Then there is
            no other way because I don&#39;t think this can be fixed. If you try to fix things, it will get worse. I
            don&#39;t want it to be a burden on my mind. Let&#39;s end the relationship. Here. Thank you for the two
            years.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I apologize if I have been wrong for two years. You are right. If we continue,
            this relationship will burden each other. I will not push myself. Thank you for two years.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After my idealism sacrificed my friendship and love. I decided to finish my thesis
            and graduate from university. After graduating, I built my business all from scratch. Learned the lessons I
            learned during my old company. I&#39;ve been through struggles in the past. I was used to how hard it was to
            live and run a business. My business was running smoothly. I could give my siblings money and buy a new car
            for my parents. But on a rainy morning, I got word that one of my best friends, Rolland, had died in a car
            accident. I hadn&#39;t seen him in a long time, and at that moment, it was as if I was the most regretful
            person in the world. I don&#39;t stop crying all day long because I regret what I did in the past. I had
            become a selfish person and the meanest person to them all. I wished I could see him one last time. But
            unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t. God&#39;s destiny couldn&#39;t be changed, nor can past events. Rolland&#39;s
            death made me realize to not be greedy and selfish. I knew that I was not the center of the world, and the
            world didn&#39;t revolve around me. I decided to move to another city to start a new life and start a new
            version of myself.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c7">Present-day</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;DAMIAN, is that you?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;I thought we would never meet again,&quot; said Alessa &nbsp;with a moved
            face</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How have you been?&quot; Alessa asked me.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">I looked at her, and involuntarily, my tears flowed as if all the regrets came out.
            This was the first time I had met her since I broke up with her.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">She worked as one of the managers in a company that worked with my company. No wonder
            we met there. Since that meeting and above all, we have worked together. We chatted a lot, and I confessed
            to her that I regretted what I did at that time. Alessa had made peace with the situation and accepted her
            past. She understood my feelings at that moment. I was grateful that Alessa had forgiven me after what I
            did. On the same occasion, Alessa and I visited Rolland&#39;s grave. Unintentionally there was also Evan,
            who was visiting Rolland&#39;s grave.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;How have you been, Evan?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Evan looks shocked</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Damian, is that you? Ohh, my dear friend, I miss you all the time.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes. Me too.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We cried in front of Rolland&#39;s Grave, and it felt nostalgic to when we were
            young. Even though we lived apart and lived our own lives. The memory of youth would never fade. We passed
            through our childhood with laughter and tears. All of that was given so that we become strong in the future.
            I was very grateful to my friends. Maybe without him, I would never have changed. Not forgetting my youth
            was a memorable memory.</span></p>
