                                    bears a devilish
                                    appearance shouted. He immediately ran to the mouth of the cave and pointed his
                                    right index finger to the
                                    brightest star in the sky. &ldquo;This means we are going in the right direction,
                                    Ophir! I think we are
                                    going to find a village tomorrow!&rdquo; The boy continued as he looked happily at
                                    his interlocutor.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y-yes. I hope so,&rdquo; answered the boy who bears a
                                    resemblance to a bird.
                                    &ldquo;Please sit down, Bel. It&rsquo;s not warm over there,&rdquo; he said in a
                                    concerned tone.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cheerful boy laughed as he approached his worried friend.
                                    He sat across from him,
                                    near the campfire he previously cast. In the light of the flame, the devilish
                                    features of the boy were
                                    becoming apparent. His skin was uncommonly pale. There were no pupils in his eyes.
                                    Only a solid color of
                                    crimson was visible. His nails and teeth are razor-sharp like a carnivorous beast.
                                    He had a tail that
                                    further alienated him from a regular human and a striking pair of goat-like horns on
                                    his head that
                                    established his appearance as a demon. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was no surprise that he never liked his appearance, as it
                                    definitely would strike
                                    fear in those around him. As the kin to the dreadful fiend, his kind was cursed with
                                    the power of the abyss.
                                    They were the symbol of blasphemy and destruction in the eye of the masses; they
                                    were the minorities of this
                                    world, often being ostracized or even killed by the hands of the holy believer. The
                                    boy knew this as he
                                    experienced the exact treatment. His family members were purged, leaving him alone
                                    in this unjust world. He
                                    covered most of his body with clothes, coiled his tail around his right leg, and
                                    desperately his horns with
                                    a hood to avoid discrimination by the local villagers.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, however, he was smiling. He finally had
                                    something that he always
                                    wished upon the stars. He found his one and only friend, someone who could drive his
                                    fear away.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">His name was Ophir. He&rsquo;s the boy in front of him, a
                                    demihuman with the features
                                    of Aves. Unlike the devilish kind, his race, often called Aarakocra, was a prominent
                                    kind in this region.
                                    They were the ones who conquered the sky with their wings. They were the ones who
                                    could easily traverse this
                                    mountainous region and made the most powerful leader in this region. The boy
                                    resembled a golden eagle except
                                    for his timid personality. His body was also abnormally small for a bird of prey,
                                    and he was still unable to
                                    use his wings to soar in the broad sky.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">While he wrapped his body with his wings, Ophir looked at the
                                    two fish they cooked
                                    inside the campfire.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think the fish are ready, Bel.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; He quickly grabbed the fish on a
                                    stick and ate it. Ophir
                                    waited patiently for his dinner to cool off. </span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;These are the last two fish that we have. We
                                    don&rsquo;t have any more food,
                                    Bel.&rdquo; Ophir said anxiously.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m sure we will find a
                                    village tomorrow. My hunch is
                                    always right, remember,&rdquo; said Bel as he immediately choked on his food.
                                    &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sure
                                    we&rsquo;ll find an abandoned house where we could temporarily stay and find a local
                                    market to
                                    steal.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">After hearing what Bel said, Ophir looked down as he still
                                    showed his
                                    anxiousness.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are we going to do this forever, Bel? What if we get
                                    caught by the local
                                    villagers, or even worse, the local gang? They are not going to spare us for what we
                                    have
                                    done.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bel turned down his smile, pondering on Ophir&rsquo;s fear.
                                    &ldquo;I
                                    know&hellip;it&rsquo;s been a while since we escaped that internment camp in Kigal.
                                    Since then, we steal the
                                    food from every village we&rsquo;ve found, moving from one to another if we almost
                                    get caught.&rdquo; Bel
                                    stopped for a while.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And in the last village...I&rsquo;ve realized that I
                                    only dragged you down,
                                    Bel,&rdquo; said Ophir as tears started to well up in his eyes. &ldquo;If I
                                    wasn&rsquo;t such a burden, we
                                    could stay in that village longer. If only&hellip; I could fly&hellip;&rdquo;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Looking at dejected Ophir, Bel knew that he needed to think
                                    of something. Ever since
                                    he fell and almost got caught in the last village, Ophir had felt guilty and thought
                                    of himself as a burden
                                    to Bel. Now they need to find a new source of food. Since the wildlife of this
                                    region is too unforgiving for
                                    the two boys, the only option is to find a village where they could steal.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a while, Bel shook his head and started to regain his
                                    smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
                                    cry, Ophir. It&rsquo;s not your fault. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll be able to survive
                                    in the next village.
                                    Besides, now I know what our main goal is going to be.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ophir tried to stop the tears by wiping them off. &ldquo;What
                                    is it?&rdquo;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The capital city, Elam! My grandfather once said that
                                    it&rsquo;s a place where
                                    everyone has a chance to live and get a job. My grandfather said it, so it must be
                                    true! He said that even
                                    my kind could find a place there, as long as you could contribute your skill to the
                                    city.&rdquo; said Bel
                                    exhilaratingly as he began to stand up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we could join the
                                    capital gang with our skill
                                    as a thief. With a bit more practice, we could be the best thief duo in all of the
                                    highlands! We could have
                                    our nickname. You could be&hellip; Ophiuchus, just like the giant constellation of a
                                    man holding a snake in
                                    the sky! And I could be&hellip; hmm&hellip; Ah! Capricornus, just like my horns!
                                    Ain&rsquo;t that
                                    awesome!&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bel&rsquo;s optimism quickly cheered Ophir. &ldquo;Ophiuchus!
                                    I can&rsquo;t wait for
                                    that, Bel!&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, I know you are going to be excited, Ophir!
                                    Grandfather said that the
                                    capital city was in the northernmost mountain region of the highlands. Then, we
                                    follow the Northern Star,
                                    and we are good to go!&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Both of them finished their dinner in a happy mood.
                                    Bel&rsquo;s plan sparked new hope
                                    for the two of them. It promised a new life, a way better life, compared to their
                                    current state of living.
                                    In their far away goal, the nearest destination was to find a nearby village for
                                    them to find food. For now,
                                    both of them were resting, waiting for the daylight.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c6">The two woke up as the sun began to rise. They felt energized
                                    after the rest and
                                    found a new goal. After </span><span class="c6">Bel</span><span
                                    class="c0">&nbsp;cast off the campfire, they
                                    embarked on their journey to find a new village. Heading up north, they tried their
                                    best to climb the
                                    mountainous region, pass through the taiga, and hide from the local beasts as the
                                    wandering adventurers.
                                    After spending half a day roaming across the nature of the highlands, they finally
                                    found a village.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s the village of Anshan, located at the foot of the
                                    mountain with the same
                                    name. It&rsquo;s a rather lively village, with thousands estimated to live in this
                                    settlement. As they
                                    entered the village gate, Bel and Ophir immediately searched for their temporary
                                    hideout. Luckily, they
                                    found a dilapidated house at the edge of the village.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What luck! We find ourselves a good hideout!&rdquo;
                                    said Bel happily.
                                    &ldquo;With the location near the cliff edge, I&rsquo;m sure no one will come to
                                    this house except
                                    us!&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. I hope so,&rdquo; said Ophir. &ldquo;Then shall
                                    we find the market,
                                    Bel?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Bel paused for a while as he immediately
                                    thought of
                                    something.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Bel?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Listen, Ophir. Whatever might happen later, remember
                                    to come back to this
                                    place. If something bad happens, leave me be and run to this place, okay? This place
                                    is pretty secluded, and
                                    I&rsquo;m sure you will lose those who are chasing you.&rdquo; Hearing this, Ophir
                                    was dazed.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wh-what are you talking about, Bel!? I will never
                                    leave you! I want us to come
                                    back to this house together!&rdquo; The boy said in a shaky voice and with teary
                                    eyes. Looking at Ophir, Bel
                                    instantly regretted the things he said before. He then smiled and grabbed Ophir
                                    shoulder.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha, you&rsquo;re right! We are going back to this
                                    place together! Now come
                                    on! Let&#39;s go to the market!&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Ophir shouted while he regained his
                                    smile.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two then went off to the village market. It was in the
                                    square, packed with many
                                    people as the sun was on the brink of sinking. As far as eyes could see, there were
                                    stalls everywhere,
                                    selling everything from clothes, food, and equipment, to even spell scrolls. </span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">After looking around, Bel and Ophir fixed their eyes on the
                                    local bakery stall.
                                    Before they looted the place, they knew that they needed a diversion to keep the
                                    people&rsquo;s attention
                                    away from them. In order to accomplish that, Bel casted a fire to the nearby tree.
                                    As the fire quickly
                                    spread to the tree, many tried to extinguish the fire as they feared the fire would
                                    spread to the stalls.
                                    Both Bel and Ophir hurriedly grabbed every piece of bread they could carry and ran
                                    away from the crowd.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">They ran like the wind, slowly feeling confident that they
                                    succeeded. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Looks like we are going to eat tonight, Ophir!&rdquo;
                                    said Bel as he ran.
                                    &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s go to the house and&mdash;&rdquo; Bel&rsquo;s utterance was
                                    interrupted as he bumped
                                    into someone. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;All you alright, Bel!&rdquo; </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I guess&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Ah! It&rsquo;s a demon! Somebody help!&rdquo;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c6 c9"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c9 c6">The scream quickly alarmed Bel. He immediately noticed
                                    that his hood was removed
                                    as he collided. Now, his horns are showing to a fearful villager who is trying to
                                    get some help from the
                                    other villagers.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The scream quickly alarmed Bel. He immediately noticed that
                                    his hood has removed as
                                    he collided. His horns were shown to the fearful villagers who were trying to get
                                    some help from the other

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The scream spread like wildfire as more people looked at the
                                    boy with a devilish
                                    appearance. &ldquo;A demon! He must be the one who caused this fire! Kill
                                    him!&rdquo; screamed one of the
                                    villagers.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ophir, run.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But, Bel&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;RUN NOW!&rdquo; Screamed Bel as he cast a flame into
                                    his right hand and threw
                                    it into the gazing crowd. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The crowd screamed in terror as the fire burned a couple of
                                    villagers. &ldquo;Ahh!
                                    The demon is attacking! Get the guards now!&rdquo; cried one of the
                                    villagers.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He looked at this scene, realized that his friend was in
                                    grave danger. He knew that
                                    Bel was going to be killed, yet he couldn&rsquo;t do anything. Bel&rsquo;s scream
                                    signaled his previous
                                    advice: &ldquo;Just leave me be and run to the hideout.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">So Ophir ran. He held back his tears and kept running to
                                    their hideout. As he ran
                                    away from the market, a couple of paladins showed up in front of Bel. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Akin to the blasphemous fiend, prepare to meet your
                                    end!&rdquo; said one of
                                    the paladins as he drew his sword. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Bel looked behind him and then smiled. He knew Ophir had
                                    already run away, just like
                                    what he wanted. Now he could close his eyes and recall his short yet joyful moments
                                    as the paladins were
                                    approaching.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take care, Ophir, my one and only
                                    friend.&rdquo;</span></p>
