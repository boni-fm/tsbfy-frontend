                                    speaks. Of course, he
                                    is smiling, who wouldn&#39;t be happy if that one girl you have liked since tenth
                                    grade in high school
                                    actually had the same feeling towards you. It feels like a dream, she&rsquo;s like
                                    Madonna in the middle of
                                    dobby. Tall, beautiful hair, slender body, has long and curly eyelashes, not to
                                    mention first in class,
                                    absolute nerd, good at sport, and has the heart of a saint, and has the most
                                    beautiful smile in the world.
                                    Somehow, he&#39;s mid in class, surprisingly also a huge nerd, not really handsome
                                    nor has he had many
                                    achievements, at least he&#39;s confident with his looks thanks to grandma who
                                    always reminds him of how
                                    handsome he is.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I just like you,&quot; she said. Wow, he really
                                    doesn&rsquo;t understand the
                                    logic of attractive people. The scene can be seen pretty much in every romance
                                    movie, predictable. The
                                    prince charming fell in love with the servant&rsquo;s kindness, the lovely princess
                                    can&rsquo;t resist the
                                    butler&rsquo;s charisma, not to mention the boss and secretary clich&eacute;. He had
                                    always loved that kind
                                    of story but never imagined that it would actually happen in his life.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You can say that he is very much insecure. When they are
                                    together on today&rsquo;s
                                    Sunday date, all the people in town at least take a glance at her, appreciating her
                                    beauty while it lasts
                                    before they split away and never bump into her ever again. She just wears casual
                                    tees and
                                    jeans.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&rsquo;t really fashionable,&quot; she murmurs
                                    cutely. Of course, she is,
                                    with that face and body proportion she even makes her school uniform a runaway fit.
                                    He is glad, so that he
                                    at least can match with her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first time they talked, in a civic education class.
                                    Boring, no one likes civic
                                    education class. Sitting in class studying the constitution, even her beautiful eyes
                                    want to hide. But that
                                    old hag in front of the whiteboard somehow had an idea to ruin her sweet
                                    dreams,&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Can you recite Constitution no.12 about Pancasila as a
                                    source of law in
                                    Indonesia?&quot;. Half sleeping, of course she wasn&rsquo;t listening. He, being
                                    dramatic, wanted to be her
                                    mighty hero by raising his hand after she faded out for almost 30 seconds. After his
                                    dramatic presentation,
                                    he looked at her. She let out a crooked smile, half asleep. He swore that was the
                                    most beautiful smile he
                                    had ever seen in his life, after his grandmother, of course. After that, they
                                    somehow ended up in pairs for
                                    next week&#39;s presentation. That was the first time they ever talked in their two
                                    years of high school
                                    life. Up till now, his feelings towards her haven&#39;t changed a bit.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They&rsquo;re heading to the nearest mall, as expected double
                                    nerd, no one wants to
                                    watch a biography movie on a date, except for them. The movie was partially boring,
                                    but he never once let
                                    down his smile, with her hand intertwined around his, it was instantly the best
                                    movie he had ever watched.
                                    He glances at her every five minutes, examining her facial expression, mostly flat,
                                    but that was the
                                    prettiest she&#39;s ever been, thanks to the dimmed movie theater lightning.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After what feels like eternity, the movie ends. It&#39;s 8
                                    PM, still they have plenty
                                    of time as tomorrow is the weekend. They decided to go to the boy&rsquo;s house. It
                                    was their first
                                    anniversary. Before going home, they decided to buy half a dozen mini egg tarts to
                                    celebrate their mini
                                    occasion. Walking together in silence, but they knew even without seeing each
                                    other&#39;s faces, those
                                    smiles never faded.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">As he is in charge of being the dramatic boyfriend, but his
                                    brain, filled with
                                    butterflies, forgets to buy a tiny candle for their mini celebration. She
                                    laughs,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;Let me get it in alfa near transJakarta
                                    stop,&quot; she suggests. The boy
                                    almost lets out a voice until she interrupts,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I want to buy some &lsquo;bread&rsquo; too.&quot; Aah,
                                    he gasps and turns an
                                    understanding gesture.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;don&rsquo;t be long,&quot; he said while preparing some
                                    tote bags for
                                    her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">While waiting for her, he slipped some orange juice from the
                                    refrigerator, her
                                    favorite, poured some into his fanciest mug, and arranged the egg tarts on the table
                                    prettily. While
                                    waiting, he fiddles with his laptop, finding a good playlist for their tiny
                                    occasion. Fifteen minutes, there
                                    is no sign of footsteps at the front door. He checked his phone, no sign of a
                                    blinking light notification.
                                    Ah, he remembers there is a construction of a bridge near that store; she perhaps
                                    took the longer route to
                                    avoid the construction area. He patiently waits while poking the cream from the egg
                                    tarts, sweet and
                                    creamy.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thirty minutes had passed. She should have come ten minutes
                                    ago, reached out his
                                    phone, typing in WhatsApp&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Where are you? You still remember the way back home,

                                    checklist, not delivered, she is offline. He texts her again through messaging, but
                                    still no answer. Call
                                    her phone, out of service.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Did the battery die?&rsquo;. He rushed to the front
                                    door, didn&#39;t bother to
                                    wear a jacket, and with just a slipper he ran. Ruthlessly, he pushes the alfa door.
                                    The cashier gave him a
                                    scowl look while saying&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello, welcome to Alfa, happy shopping&quot;
                                    don&rsquo;t bother to reply, he
                                    asked the cashier girl,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Was there a girl buying a candle and a pad here about

                                    bad day too.&nbsp;</span>
                            </p>

                                    anymore.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                    there is no sign of

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Have you tried to call her phone?&quot; he sighed
                                    loudly as a reply,</span></p>

                                    just started three hours
                                    ago and she is really tired at the moment.&nbsp;</span></p>

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;Oh, my dear God, thank you&quot;. He rushed out
                                    and ran, still trying to
                                    call her phone, still answered by a robot customer service lady. He prayed all along
                                    the way, his face
                                    whitened as all the blood flowing right to his heart pumping it back and forth
                                    hoping that the body
                                    wouldn&#39;t faint in the middle of the road. He then takes turns going to the
                                    construction area. Still no
                                    sign of her presence. He then turns another way, on a small road, wondering if she
                                    got lost between the
                                    alley. Desperate, he returns home hoping that she is already at the table while
                                    arranging the mini candles
                                    in her favorite egg tarts. He holds his breath as he turns the door handle.</span>

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you here?&quot;. The only thing that answers him is
                                    Tori Kelly from his
                                    laptop playlist singing Paper Hearts, her favorite song.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My god where are you?!&quot;. He dashes back into the
                                    road, still trying to
                                    reach her phone, investigating all the possibilities of her being lost or simply
                                    going somewhere else to buy
                                    a surprise gift for their celebration. Who knows?</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">11PM, almost three hours and he was still running through the
                                    block. His shirt is wet
                                    from sweat, his face is redder than a boiled crab, his smartphone overheats, and his
                                    love is nowhere to be
                                    found. He even went to her boarding house, but she was not there. There is no way
                                    she went back to her
                                    parents&rsquo; house because they live across the island. He contacts everyone who
                                    possibly knows her
                                    locality, from her best friend to her tutor students, and all the answers are
                                    no.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Desperate, he went to the police station, wanting to make a
                                    report of a missing
                                    person. Unfortunately, the police can&rsquo;t process his report because she
                                    hasn&#39;t been missing for
                                    approximately 24 hours. He swears at the officers but he can&rsquo;t do anything.
                                    So, he went back home and
                                    waited, hoping that she was just trying to prank him even though it&rsquo;s not
                                    really funny and he almost
                                    had a heart attack because of her. Silently, he didn&rsquo;t bother to put the egg
                                    tarts on the refrigerator
                                    and decided to sit in the hallway so that he could hear if someone was
                                    coming.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">3AM, his eyes wide open, almost crying, his fingers
                                    restlessly playing with the hem
                                    of his shirt, hoping it will calm him down. Eyes and ears steady pay attention into
                                    any blink of his phone
                                    hoping the notification with a red heart shows up.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">10AM, he startled, since when had he fallen asleep in the
                                    hallway? He immediately
                                    checks his phone, no notification. He rubbed his face roughly, frustrated, when did
                                    this go wrong? does it
                                    when he did not insist to company her to the market, or when he suggests to buy that
                                    stupid candle, or when
                                    they planning their date from weeks ago for their anniversary. Anger filled his
                                    body, he then decided to
                                    wash his face in the bathroom, change his dirty clothes, and decide to go out and
                                    continue his
                                    search.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">While walking, he did not stop just once, trying to contact
                                    anyone who possibly knows
                                    her location, waiting for good news. When he passed by the river bank, he noticed
                                    that somehow the place was
                                    more crowded than usual. There&#39;s a police officer and some rescue teams
                                    preparing a speedboat. His heart
                                    pounding loudly. It couldn&rsquo;t be true. Can not beat his curiosity, he asked the
                                    nearest person
                                    there</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Did something happen?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They found a body near the bank,&quot; the person

                                    river. His heart is going crazy. He prayed in his heart that what he was thinking
                                    was not what actually
                                    happened. When suddenly, a man on the speedboat yells out that they already secured
                                    the body of the poor
                                    victim. He glanced at the body bag. It seemed like the person rather had a slender
                                    body and a little strand
                                    of long black hair sticking out. It is a woman. He fell to his knees, covering his
                                    mouth with his trembling
                                    hands, kneeling in disbelief. Thirteen minutes later, the police identify that the
                                    body is a teenage girl.
                                    There is a wound in the back of her head because of a blunt object collision. The
                                    police are still
                                    investigating the case, whether it is a murder or suicide case. Then the body was
                                    taken to the hospital for
                                    further identification.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is still sitting in his place, not moving even an inch.
                                    When suddenly, at 2 PM,
                                    his phone rang. Unknown number.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello,&quot; a man with a very low voice speaks through
                                    the speaker. He stated
                                    that he is a police officer in charge of the boy&#39;s report from last night. He
                                    said that he had good
                                    news, that his team had already found her. If he hadn&#39;t said the next sentence,
                                    the boy&#39;s heart
                                    could have stopped immediately. The drowning victim who he just saw earlier is her,
                                    his girl. The officer
                                    then asked him to go to the police station to be interrogated. With a straight voice
                                    the boy answered. All
                                    of his emotions flew away from moments ago. The color of his world went gray.</span>

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few years later, he sits on the river bank near the bridge.
                                    He could recall every
                                    memory, every dialogue, every scene that happened that day. Scrolling through his
                                    phone, he messages the
                                    very same number every day. That damned day, when he arrived at the police station,
                                    there were a few police
                                    officers and about 4-5 construction workers waiting while being handcuffed. The
                                    police explained that his
                                    girl was harrassed and murdered by those workers. It happened so fast, when the girl
                                    was walking home from
                                    the store, she passed the construction site of the bridge. The typical workers
                                    teased the poor girl, from
                                    the frontal and inappropriate remarks, until one of the two workers tried to follow
                                    her and even touched her
                                    shoulder, sexually harassing her. The girl, of course, gave a reaction of rejection,
                                    but the workers
                                    persistently continued to tease and harass her. Because of defense reflex, the girl
                                    slapped one of the
                                    workers. Shock, the angry worker pushed the girl backward too hard, the girl
                                    naturally lost her balance and
                                    hit her head on construction concrete. She was unconscious right then and there.
                                    Panicked, the workers tried
                                    to save the girl who was bleeding profusely on the back of her head. When the rest
                                    of the co-workers
                                    gathered to check on her, the girl was no longer breathing. Not wanting to get in
                                    trouble for killing
                                    someone, they agreed to drown the poor girl&#39;s body in the river.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">His eyes have lost their spark as he types word by word on
                                    his phone, texting her
                                    number as if she could read or reply to those chats. Everyday, he plays Paper Hearts
                                    by Tori Kelly to sleep,
                                    buys some egg tarts on the weekends, and never runs out of orange juice in his
                                    refrigerator. He&#39;ll do
                                    anything to keep memories with her. He even watches the biography movie that they
                                    watch on their anniversary
                                    every once in a while. He wants to remember every detail that happens with
                                    her.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many years later, at 74 years old, he still has the same
                                    exact smartphone. Even
                                    though his friends and grandkids say that he is very outdated, he doesn&#39;t care.
                                    Because that is the only
                                    thing that keeps his memory with her. Although he has a new love, a new family, and
                                    a new life, he still
                                    waits for her every second. He tells them about his day, his complaints, their
                                    birthdays, anniversaries, his
                                    experiences, adventures, as if the old cellphone was a diary, and even though he
                                    routinely turned on the
                                    reminder to always send a message at least once a month, because apart from his new
                                    life, this is what makes
                                    him the happiest.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Today is their umpteenth anniversary. He had half a dozen egg
                                    tarts and two glasses
                                    of orange juice set on the table. His shriveled fingers, because of aging, were a
                                    little too overwhelmed to
                                    light a match for a few small candles in his egg tarts. His dim eyes reached for the
                                    glasses beside the
                                    drawer. When his vision was clear enough, he reached into the old smartphone in his
                                    trouser pocket, typing
                                    some sweet words to the girl to celebrate their special day. As usual, he pressed
                                    the send button. But for
                                    some reason, something was different. The status, which usually only ticked one
                                    unsent sign, suddenly became
                                    two blue ticks. Not believing his eyesight because he was getting nearsighted, he
                                    put the cellphone back on
                                    the table. Then he heard a subtle ding. She replied, he isn&#39;t hallucinated as he
                                    never chugged a glass
                                    of alcohol today.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorryyy I took too long, I&#39;ll be there
                                    soon, don&#39;t eat the
                                    egg tart without me! &rsquo; He read those words carefully, then let out a small
                                    smile, before typing a few
                                    words to reply.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;What took you so long? I&#39;m tired of waiting for
                                    you. If you don&#39;t come
                                    in five minutes, I&#39;ll start eating them one by one until you run through that
                                    door! &rsquo; Right after
                                    he sent the message, he heard the doorbell ring. He woke up immediately from his
                                    chair and walked briskly
                                    toward the front door. With half-quivering hands, he turned the door handle. As the
                                    door opens, he can see
                                    that exact smile, that long beautiful hair, and that face, standing in front of him
                                    while waving a tote bag
                                    filled with candles, orange juice, and maxi pads, giggling. His smile widens as his
                                    eyes water, his heart
                                    filled with joy, this isn&#39;t a dream, she is standing right here, with the same
                                    outfit as the last time
                                    they met. The man was stunned to cry, and the girl said in a voice that he missed
                                    the most.&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sorry you waited so long. Eey handsome, what&#39;s with
                                    that face?&nbsp; did
                                    you cry?&quot;, he chuckled, and held her hand with his crinkled hands, led the girl
                                    to the dining room, and
                                    asked the girl to sit down. He even joked that he had eaten half of the tarts. They
                                    kept smiling and
                                    laughing while the girl put the candles she had brought and replaced the melted one
                                    that he lighted earlier
                                    on the egg tart. They held hands while looking at each other face to face after
                                    everything was set up and
                                    pretty, and the girl uttered the most beautiful smile.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you for waiting for me, I know it&#39;s really
                                    late but thank you too for
                                    filling my days happily I always read your messages, I&#39;m really happy that you
                                    don&#39;t forget me,
                                    happy anniversary, I love you&quot; the boys&rsquo; eyes finally have his color, his
                                    eyes filled with
                                    happiness tears as he replies with a trembling voice</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Happy anniversary!&quot; they blow candles together
                                    with a happy smile. Then
                                    the guy naturally closed his eyes to make a wish, and like magic, when he opened his
                                    eyes, he was young
                                    again. He was himself on the first anniversary. Like when they went on that date
                                    with his ugly nerd T-shirt.
                                    Then, they ate the cake together with a smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
