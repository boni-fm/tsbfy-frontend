                            <p>
                                My name is Audrey. I was 12 years old when my family and I were involved in a
                                terrible conflagration. I couldn&#39;t remember anything except for the screaming sounds
                                and the
                                piercing pain of my burning skin. &nbsp;When I woke up, I had no memory of ever being a
                                child.
                                My parents, along with my sister, died before they could be identified. I&#39;ve spent
                                these
                                past few months searching through our memories to see if there was something that could
                                shed
                                light on what happened in the fire. There&#39;s nothing. It seems like the only way to
                                find any
                                answers would be to dig into our own minds. So, I have. But I keep coming back to the
                                same
                                questions. Why did I end up here? How was I able to survive the fire? I wish there was
                                someone
                                that could tell me the answers. Someone who knew what happened and why I found myself
                                this way.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sit alone in a somehow abandoned hospital room, staring at
                                    the walls as I wait
                                    for the nurse to come back with the information I&#39;m looking for. All around me
                                    are people
                                    sleeping peacefully, their heads resting against the soft pillows they&#39;re
                                    sitting on. The
                                    silence is deafening. Every so often I hear footsteps walking down the hall, and
                                    when I do look
                                    up, I can see nurses checking everyone&#39;s vitals or changing someone&#39;s
                                    sheets. As far as
                                    hospitals go, it&#39;s not too bad. There are a lot of flowers decorating the halls,
                                    making sure
                                    patients know they are loved and cared for. The smell of fresh flowers fills the
                                    air, but it
                                    isn&#39;t enough to calm my nerves.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, after what feels like hours but is probably only
                                    minutes later, the door
                                    to the room opens, and a familiar woman enters. It&#39;s nurse Edna. She walks
                                    towards me and
                                    sets a stack of files down on the bed next to where I am sitting. Her blonde hair
                                    reaches her
                                    waist, and she smiles at me. &quot;So, how you feeling?&quot; she asks.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Fine, Edna.&quot; I respond flatly. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She raises an eyebrow. &quot;That doesn&#39;t really sound
                                    like a fine answer.
                                    Are you sure you don&#39;t want to talk about it?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sigh and shake my head. &quot;It&#39;s just been bothering
                                    me for weeks
                                    now.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyebrows raise even higher than before. &quot;Audrey,
                                    what exactly has been
                                    bothering you?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I...don&#39;t know how to explain it,&quot; I finally
                                    say. &quot;But every
                                    time I try to think about it, I can&#39;t make sense of everything. Maybe you should
                                    start by
                                    talking about the fire...&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a moment, she nods. &quot;Alright. You may have heard
                                    about it
                                    already.&quot; I nod in response. The news is playing on repeat in the background
                                    right now.
                                    &quot;Your family had a quite large library, right? Tons of books and papers in that
                                    place.
                                    &nbsp;They kept quite a collection.&quot; I hum, trying to picture the house.
                                    &quot;Well, papers
                                    aren&#39;t that hard to be burned. That&#39;s why the police concluded that the
                                    library was
                                    where the fire originated from.&quot; I reply, &quot;So, there must be someone who
                                    is
                                    responsible for all that accident. There is no way the fire came out of
                                    nowhere.&quot; &quot;The
                                    lamp&quot; I slightly raised my eyebrows, &quot;What?&quot; She explains &quot;The
                                    candle lamp,
                                    dear. Somebody forgot to put out the light. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&#39;s why the flames started. And then the heat from
                                    them spread throughout
                                    the house until the fire got too strong for the oxygen tanks to handle. Then, boom!
                                    Everything
                                    went up in flames.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I frown, trying to piece together how all of this could have
                                    possibly gone wrong.
                                    &quot;That does seem a little out of character.&quot; &quot;Yes, well, there are
                                    some theories
                                    floating around, but none of them are very probable, at least none I&#39;ve heard
                                    of.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, my eyes widen. &quot;There was something
                                    else!&quot; I quickly grab the
                                    folder on top of my stack. &quot;I think I read somewhere that one person ran away
                                    from the
                                    house! That person escaped through the window. We never saw him, he was just gone
                                    before we
                                    could figure out what was going on.&quot; I pause, &quot;Did anyone follow
                                    him?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The nurse shakes her head. &quot;Not a soul. It wasn&#39;t
                                    reported that anyone
                                    ran, but I imagine there will be many more reports to come about his disappearance.
                                    He left
                                    behind a note though. I believe the reason he ran away was because he didn&#39;t
                                    want to get
                                    involved.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t he want to get involved?&quot;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Maybe he felt guilty. For leaving your family behind, I
                                    suppose.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You mean he may be responsible for all that happened
                                    ?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah.. it could be.&quot; She answered unsurely.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nod as I look over all of the pages that are written neatly
                                    in black pen.
                                    Suddenly, an image comes to mind, of the man in the photo. He looks vaguely
                                    familiar.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Excuse me? Do you recognize the man in the
                                    picture?&quot; I ask, pointing
                                    at one of the pictures that is on file. I feel my cheeks turn pink when I realize I
                                    said it out
                                    loud.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The nurse looks at where I&#39;m pointing and frowns.
                                    &quot;I&#39;m afraid I
                                    don&#39;t. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I look back down at the page I had previously marked
                                    as
                                    important and begin reading again. This time the man in the picture gets my
                                    attention, despite
                                    what the nurse thought.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After finishing the book, I close it with a heavy heart.
                                    It&#39;s been two days
                                    since I last slept. At first I tried to stay awake all night while I researched
                                    everything I
                                    could find about the mysterious arsonist, but soon I began to run out of energy.
                                    With a groan, I
                                    set the file aside. It&#39;s a bit disappointing to find out that there&#39;s
                                    nothing new in
                                    regards to the case, but at least it&#39; s better than nothing.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before I fall asleep, I glance one more time at the page,
                                    hoping that one part
                                    will trigger something in me, but nothing happens. Instead, I decide to get a glass
                                    of water,
                                    and walk slowly across the dark room to the bathroom. Once there, I open the cabinet
                                    and pull
                                    out a bottle of pills. After swallowing the pill dry, I lean against the sink and
                                    stare vacantly
                                    at the mirror as I begin taking deep breaths. Soon enough, I fall asleep, still
                                    wearing my
                                    clothes from the day before, my face buried in the cool surface of the sink.</span>

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I wake up, I immediately become aware of two things.
                                    One, I&#39;m warm.
                                    Secondly, my throat is parched. I try to swallow, but my mouth refuses to cooperate,
                                    causing me
                                    to cough. I try to speak, but once again nothing comes out. I feel panic begin to
                                    rise in me. I
                                    can&#39; t breathe. I try to push myself off the ground, but that only makes it
                                    worse. Panic
                                    starts bubbling in my chest as I begin hyperventilating. I manage to get up a bit,
                                    leaning
                                    heavily on the counter as I struggle to remain upright. I breathe deeply.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Calm down. Breathe. In....and out. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I continue breathing in and out. Slowly my body begins to
                                    relax a bit, although
                                    I&#39;m still shaking uncontrollably. The burning images of the past still lingers
                                    in my mind.
                                    Mom, Dad, Lily, I wish I could save you all of you back then.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Slowly, I reach for the small sink and turn on the faucet,
                                    letting the cold water
                                    wash the remnants of the pill off of my neck. Once I finish washing my hands, I turn
                                    around and
                                    walk out of the bathroom. Then, I went out of the apartment door. In the corridor, a
                                    small voice
                                    calls out for me to stop, but I ignore it. I&#39;m aware that I&#39;m still not sane
                                    enough for
                                    it. The words &#39;hospital&#39; ring in my ears. I keep walking.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The voices call out to me again, telling me to turn around
                                    and return inside. I
                                    turn back and saw a silhouette of a man. My heart starts to pound fast. I quickly
                                    turn around
                                    and try to run away from it but the sound of footsteps is getting louder. He chased
                                    after me,
                                    closer, closer. My breath quickens, becoming shorter. &nbsp; A hand wraps around my
                                    wrist,
                                    stopping me from escaping. The world becomes blurry around the edges as tears roll
                                    down my face.
                                    The voices get closer. So close. &nbsp;Too close. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Something flashes in front of my eyes. Something red. Red
                                    blood. &nbsp;Blood is
                                    dripping from something. Someone? Someone&#39;s nose? &nbsp;I don&#39;t care.
                                    Someone needs
                                    help, someone is dying. Who?</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">My vision goes white and black, and suddenly the pain
                                    disappears. Everything goes
                                    silent, and then fades into darkness.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I open my eyes I see Dr. Jones staring at me
                                    intently.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You okay?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I blink slowly, attempting to focus on the doctor in front of
                                    me, but it&#39;s
                                    difficult, the memories I just remembered flooding back. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m
                                    fine.&quot; I
                                    mutter under my breath, but I know he caught it.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m sure he did anyway.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you remember anything?&quot; he asks. I frown as I
                                    try to recall if
                                    there was something specific I noticed, but nothing comes to mind. Finally, I shrug
                                    my
                                    shoulders. &quot;No, I guess not. All I remember was...that red color. Blood.&quot;
                                    The doctor
                                    frowns. &quot;Are you sure that&#39;s all that you were seeing?&quot; I give him a
                                    confused
                                    look. &nbsp;&quot;I...guess so...Why?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He doesn&#39;t respond to that at first, apparently
                                    thinking.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Have you seen any red stains on any of your clothing
                                    recently?&quot; he
                                    says eventually.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I shake my head. &quot;No.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you sure?&quot; he presses, raising an
                                    eyebrow.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time, it&#39; s my turn to frown. &quot;Of course
                                    I&#39;m sure.&quot; he
                                    stares at me for a couple more seconds, making me feel uneasy, and I&#39;m not even
                                    sure if
                                    he&#39;s looking at me directly or not. &quot;Then what were you feeling?&quot; I
                                    think for a
                                    few moments, trying to remember, but I don&#39; t know. The feeling is so vague now.
                                    I try my
                                    best to think, but my thoughts end up coming up empty.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Nothing...like...&quot; My mind is blank. I don&#39;t
                                    even know how I
                                    should describe the weirdness that was filling my head when I woke up. I don&#39;t
                                    even recall
                                    if anything else happened.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is this related to your memory problems, or did
                                    something happen while you
                                    were unconscious?&quot; he asks, &quot;It seems like you were really confused and
                                    scared, so
                                    maybe that&#39;s what caused it.&quot; he continues. I nod, &quot;Maybe. But I also
                                    don&#39;t
                                    know.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sighs, &quot;I&#39;ll leave you alone to rest, then. Try
                                    and take care of
                                    yourself, alright?&quot; I smile weakly and nod again. He leaves the room, closing
                                    the door
                                    softly behind him.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I lie there staring at the ceiling, wondering what I&#39;m
                                    supposed to do next.
                                    Should I go back to sleep? No...I need to stay awake. I have no idea what will
                                    happen if I fall
                                    back asleep. I try to clear my mind, but all I can think about is the red stain I
                                    saw. What was
                                    that all about? Why was it here? What&#39;s so special about it? And the man in the
                                    corridor.. I
                                    wonder who that is..? I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s the same man in the that picture
                                    that nurse Edna
                                    showed me. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">How long has it been since I&#39;ve actually seen him? I
                                    can&#39;t seem to
                                    remember. &nbsp;Is this some kind of dream? Am I going insane?</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let out a shaky sigh. I don&#39; t like having unanswered
                                    questions. They never
                                    make sense, and they&#39;re always followed by feelings of dread. When it feels that
                                    way, I
                                    usually end up spending most of the day crying. If I don&#39;t cry, I don&#39;t
                                    talk. If I
                                    don&#39;t talk, I don&#39;t sleep. If I don&#39;t sleep, I&#39; m tired.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And today I ended up being tired for reasons unknown.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I rub my forehead gently with my fingers as I attempt to
                                    distract my anxious
                                    thoughts from the fact that I&#39;m alone in an unfamiliar apartment with no
                                    answers.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">All of sudden, I hear soft knocks coming from the main door
                                    of the apartment.
                                    I&#39;m startling &nbsp;at the noise, sitting straight up on the bed, nearly falling
                                    off as I
                                    try to calm myself down. Who would be knocking at this hour? Then all of a sudden an
                                    ear-piercing scream &nbsp;echoes throughout the building, and my heart stops beating
                                    entirely.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was that? I jump off of the bed and rush towards the
                                    door. I pull open the
                                    door and my eyes widen as I look outside. Standing beside the entrance, looking
                                    right at me, is
                                    the man I saw earlier standing in the hallway, blood splatters all over his body.
                                    His eyes are
                                    glowing bright red, and for several seconds I stand frozen with fear. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, his gaze shifts toward the floor, and he growls
                                    angrily. Before I can
                                    react, however, he grabs hold of me with both arms, dragging me backward through the
                                    door. I
                                    yelp out loudly as my back hits the wood, my whole body jerking forward from the
                                    force of his
                                    grip on me. As he pulls me along, I notice a huge gaping wound in his stomach,
                                    oozing blood
                                    everywhere. I try to fight him off, but I&#39;m too weak to do anything.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Help...,&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Your father.. It was all his fault!&quot; </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">What does he mean? My father already long gone. He died from
                                    the fire. &nbsp;I
                                    don&#39;t understand. How did this man know about my father anyway? </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just before I can figure out why exactly I am seeing things,
                                    the man shoves me
                                    backwards and I land hard on the floor, gasping for air as the wind is knocked out
                                    of my lungs.
                                    The man stands above me, glaring furiously, his eyes glistening with bloodlust.
                                    Before I can
                                    even say anything, he pounces forward and pins me beneath his weight, pinning my
                                    arms above my
