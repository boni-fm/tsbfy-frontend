                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I flipped over the page from the book I was reading. That
                                    time, my parents were
                                    holding a party for the nobles in our kingdom like usual. I was sitting there in the
                                    library to escape
                                    having to greet their acquaintances. I hate attending parties since I have to force
                                    a smile and endure the
                                    boredom of waiting for my parents to end their conversation. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Five minutes went by when suddenly the door to my library
                                    burst wide open, revealing
                                    a little girl around my age who&#39;s most likely the culprit. She had a very bright
                                    smile and beautiful
                                    blue eyes. An unforeseen lovestruck feeling overwhelmed my heart. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I averted my eyes back to the book I was reading. From my
                                    peripheral vision, I could
                                    see the girl was closing in on me. My hands were trembling a bit. I never interact
                                    with kids my age since my
                                    parents arrange so many lessons for me in my house, let alone a noble&#39;s
                                    daughter. She jumped in and sat
                                    on the arm of the sofa where I was sitting. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, what are you reading?&quot; Her magnificent voice
                                    entered my ear. I
                                    swiveled my neck a bit and found her face just a few inches away from my face. Her
                                    gorgeous blue eyes
                                    fixated on the page I was reading. I could smell the scent of her soap wafting
                                    towards my nose. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s a tome of elemental magic.&quot; I tried to
                                    hide my embarrassment by
                                    focusing on the book. Heard the answer to her question, she threw another question.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you wearing ?&quot; She asked after she jumped
                                    down and stood in front
                                    of me, pointed at the thing in my chest. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, this? It is a protection amulet. It emits a barrier
                                    when you&#39;re in
                                    danger.&quot; I answered while holding the necklace I was wearing. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She couldn&#39;t hold her amazement, making an o-shape with
                                    her mouth.
                                    &quot;THAT&#39;S SO COOL!!&quot; She said with a loud voice, half yelling, I might
                                    add. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I tried to continue my reading session, but I couldn&#39;t
                                    focus on the book that the
                                    girl was standing in front of me, staring at me. Then she wandered around my
                                    family&#39;s library, searching
                                    for an object of interest to spend her attention. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Not five minutes passed when suddenly she grabbed my hand and
                                    dragged me out of the
                                    library to the garden. I even nearly damaged the ancient tome that has been passed
                                    down on my family for
                                    hundreds of years. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When we arrived at the garden, she swiftly sat down on one of
                                    the park benches in my
                                    garden. She then patted the space beside her, gesturing for me to sit down. I
                                    didn&#39;t have any other
                                    option, nor did I dislike the idea in the first place, so I complied. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;You know, my parents forbid me to read or study about
                                    magic,&quot; she said.
                                    &quot;They always forced me to take dancing lessons and etiquette classes. It is as
                                    though I have no other
                                    future than being a pawn for my parents to use, marrying me off to some older nobles
                                    that they think would
                                    profit them. They already married off two of my elder sisters, and I&#39;m the next
                                    in line. They brought me
                                    to this party to put my dancing and etiquette classes to the test. But, as you see,
                                    I&#39;m running away
                                    from them now.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her story had quite an impact on my feelings. I could
                                    sympathize with her. I was not
                                    close with my parents, and I have always been with the maids as far as I remember.
                                    And even after that, they
                                    put me through many classes to make me a proper noble and fit to rule the land, as
                                    they say. But I was not
                                    interested in that. I&#39;ve always been amazed by the adventurers who came and went
                                    by our territory,
                                    taking monster subjugation quests now and then. I wanted to be an adventurer. I
                                    didn&#39;t want to be a
                                    stuck-up noble that continuously schemes and sucks up others for their benefit.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Getting no reaction whatsoever, the girl wiped the tears that
                                    streamed down from her
                                    eyes. It must be hard to share a story like that with a stranger like me. &quot;Ah,
                                    sorry for bringing your
                                    mood down too. I-&quot; </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;No, not at all. I could relate to your story as well.
                                    My parents aren&#39;t
                                    forbidding me from studying magic or swordplay. They always force me to be the
                                    perfect noble that could rule
                                    the land as they see fit.&quot; I cut in before she could continue what she wanted
                                    to say, hoping it could
                                    brighten her mood. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">She smiles. &quot;Then we are two peas in a pod!&quot; She
                                    remarks with her bright
                                    and cheery voice like before. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, I guess we are two peas in a pod.&quot; </span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We continued to share stories. She talked about her favorite
                                    toys, her favorite
                                    snacks, the books she had read before, and many more things. We stayed in the garden
                                    until the sun in the
                                    sky swapped its place with the moon. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then her parents came to the garden to take her home. Seeing
                                    as she held hands with
                                    her parents and thought that I might never get a chance to see her again, I mustered
                                    up as much courage as I
                                    could to ask about her name. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing my question, she turned around and answered,
                                    &quot;Lunafreya,&quot; with her
                                    usual bright smile. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"><hr style="width:400px; margin:auto; top:20px;"/></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that incident, both our parents grew closer, and so did
                                    us. We spent time
                                    together whenever her parents went to my house to discuss their business. We did
                                    many things together. Most
                                    of the time, it was her dragging me around. But I did not dislike what she did. We
                                    read books together,
                                    pranked the maids together, went to town together, or only sat together in the
                                    garden silently watching the
                                    sun set and the moon rise. </span></p>

                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, on that one occasion, we had a big fight. On the
                                    previous visits I showed the
                                    swordplay I&#39;ve learnt so far. After seeing my swordplay, she pleaded to me to
                                    teach the swordplay. But I
                                    disagreed. She pleaded once more, but I didn&#39;t change my mind. Her mood
                                    instantly dropped. And for
                                    several subsequent visits, she is visibly angry with me. She, who always has such a
                                    bright smile, pouts and
                                    sulks when I greet her. Her eyes, that always looked so gorgeous, scowled at me
                                    whenever our eyes met. It
                                    wasn&#39;t for long that our parents noticed our fight and started questioning us.

                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s his fault for being meanie,&quot; Luna
                                    answered, pointing at me.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seeing her accusing me like that, I flipped out.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not fair, Luna! You are always so talented at
                                    everything you do! I
                                    can&#39;t play piano while you play like a famous minstrel! You always have a good
                                    mannerism while I&#39;m
                                    being called a barbarian! You could draw beautiful people with complex scenery, and
                                    I can&#39;t even draw a
                                    face properly without an oversized eye or an asymmetrical lips! It&#39;s not fair
                                    that you could always do
                                    what you wanted and be good at it. I also want something to show off to you,
                                    something that I&#39;m good at,
                                    and you could admire me for it&quot; I vomited all my pent-up feelings to the floor.
                                    Both my parents and
                                    Luna&#39;s parents were visibly shocked by that. Luna seemed shocked too. I could
                                    feel warm liquid flowing
                                    down from my eyes. I didn&#39;t know when I started crying. I wiped the tears out
                                    and ran out to my bedroom.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I didn&#39;t know how many times had passed since, but I knew
                                    it was already dark
                                    outside when Luna showed up by my bedroom&#39;s door. She was noticeably hesitant to
                                    step into my bedroom,
                                    but she swallowed her hesitation and entered the room. I was still pretending like I
                                    hadn&#39;t noticed her
                                    presence. &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, Ravus. I never knew you felt like that while
                                    playing with me. I-If you are
                                    annoyed by me playing with you, I&#39;ll stop coming here.&quot; I could hear the
                                    shaking in her voice. When
                                    she turned around to head for the exit, I hastily grabbed her hand. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait,&quot; I exclaimed.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not like I hate you or despise your existence.
                                    It&#39;s just&hellip;
                                    very hard for me to accept that you&#39;re very talented, and I envy you for that.
                                    I&#39;m sorry too for
                                    flipping out like earlier.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing my words, she smiled brightly as usual. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Then we could play together again?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess we could.&quot; I awkwardly scratched my
                                    cheek.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Thank you, Ravus. I don&#39;t know what I would do if
                                    you hate me&quot;. She
                                    seemed very happy to hear that, so much so that she pulled me into a hug. </span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">We then walked side by side to the room where our parents
                                    were. While Luna was away,
                                    they agreed to have Luna join my swordplay class and make me her senior in the
                                    class. Well, I did not make a
                                    fuss over that again, so it was a win-win situation, I guess. &nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"><hr style="width:400px; margin:auto; top:20px;"/></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, we grew even closer than before. We were almost
                                    inseparable. Someone
                                    could ask a maid about one of us, and what they found would always be the two of us.
                                    Since we were already
                                    in our teenage years, we started to go to parties thrown by the nobles. Sometimes
                                    still with our parents,
                                    other times with just the two of us. We always danced together at those parties, and
                                    we never got tired of
                                    it. Until one day, my mom jokingly said that would make a cute couple together.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hearing my mom&#39;s words, I felt my face warm and averted
                                    my eyes.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mom!&quot; I nearly yelled out of embarrassment.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Luna reflectively did the same, averting her eyes while
                                    making a light complaint to
                                    my mom. Seeing both our reactions were all our parents needed to know that we both
                                    had feelings for each
                                    other. And for the rest of that night, they weren&#39;t bringing up the topic. Later
                                    I knew they started to
                                    lay the groundwork for our engagement. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">And when finally the talk of our engagement came around, both
                                    of us sat down
                                    together. They asked our opinion about it. I couldn&rsquo;t say a word to answer
                                    their question. But Luna,
                                    while having the reddest face I had ever seen, gave her consent with a nod of
                                    agreement. And at that moment,
                                    I felt like I was the happiest man alive. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">What followed was quite hazy. Both our parents were very busy
                                    handling all sorts of
                                    preparation for our engagement party, while me and Luna were still hanging around
                                    like usual. The difference
                                    was that we didn&#39;t hesitate to hold each other&#39;s hand or even give a hug.
                                    Her soft hands and the
                                    warm feeling that I got every time I hugged her would never get replaced by anything
                                    in this world. </span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But then, that incident happened. I messed it up. Just
                                    because of a cursed ancient
                                    book talking about a magical pact with a demon. When I told Luna that I wanted to
                                    try to make a pact with a
                                    demon, she cheerily nodded in agreement. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I screwed up. I had never thought that she would be the cost
                                    of the pact. It was all
                                    my fault. If only I read that damn sentence, if only I paid a little more attention,
                                    I would still have her
                                    by my side. She is worth more than a pact with a demon. She was worth more than even
                                    my life and soul.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>

                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">I flinch when I feel a cold hand on my shoulder. I swivel my
                                    head around and find the
                                    healer of the party. Gemini is standing behind me. &quot;Get some sleep, Ravus.
                                    It&#39;s my turn to guard

                                    this morning.&quot;

                                    feel drowsy during tomorrow&#39;s battle&quot; Gemini stares at me for a moment and
                                    then walks back to his
