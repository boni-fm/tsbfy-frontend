                                    he saw his reflection in the mirror, which was half his height. He bent down to
                                    attach a crown decoration to his head. People used to call it </span><span
                                    class="c8">omprok</span><span class="c1">. The headdress was made of buffalo skin
                                    decorated with gold and red ornaments, which match the makeup.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c12">He complimented the makeup on his face, &quot;Now there is
                                    no difference between the other dancers, except...&quot; he suddenly remembered the
                                    Simbok incident yesterday.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I was sweeping sheep dung in the cage that afternoon when
                                    suddenly I heard Simbok&#39;s scream from inside, shouting my name. I immediately
                                    ran into the house and looked for Simbok. I was afraid that something might
                                    happen.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Mbok, where is Simbok?&quot; I looked for her in the
                                    kitchen, but she wasn&#39;t there, she wasn&#39;t even in the room, and I saw a
                                    shadow in my room. Simbok was there, in my room crying, and I saw my secret in his
                                    grasp. I walked over to him, kneeling on his lap.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mbok.&quot; I held back my sobs. I knew
                                    Simbok was disappointed. Simbok gripped my secret tighter, sad and disappointed with
                                    me like this. Cried and sobbed reverberate in this small bamboo room. Simbok&#39;s
                                    disappointment with what I did fell through tears and sobs. The last sob I heard
                                    from Simbok muffled the echo in this small room. Simbok stopped crying and tried to
                                    stand up, letting go of my hand on his lap. Simbok tried to stand even though the
                                    waves had hit her with imperfect footing.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Simbok said, &quot;Simbok is disappointed with you.&quot;
                                    Simbok&#39;s tears broke for the second time.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">She continued, &quot;what would your father do if he found
                                    out about this, Son?&quot; Simbok&#39;s sobs became more intense. I crawled, holding
                                    Simbok&#39;s feet tightly, crying at Simbok feet.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mbok. I know it was wrong. Sorry,
                                    Mbok,&quot; I burst into tears when Simbok pulled his leg and threw the mask on the
                                    ground.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Get rid of all this, don&#39;t let you know.&quot;
                                    Simbok left my room with disappointment still in his heart.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">In the evening, the three of us had dinner in silence.
                                    Thankfully, Simbok&#39;s eyes were no longer red, but I could see a few bruises on
                                    his eyes. I knew Simbok kept crying in his room after scolding me earlier. I heard
                                    it when I packed up my things. Even though Simbok tried to keep her voice down, this
                                    little house couldn&#39;t catch the sound of Simbok&#39;s crying. The Simbok I knew
                                    for her stubbornness broke with the sharp crash of the waves. Father&#39;s voice
                                    broke the atmosphere and started the conversation.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;How was your school, Son?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;It&#39;s fine, Father.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;You will graduate soon, don&#39;t be like me and
                                    Simbok, who didn&#39;t graduate from elementary school. In the past, I went to
                                    school, passed five villages, and walked ten kilos every day. Cough...
                                    cough...&quot; Father stopped the conversation.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Simbok rushed to give him a drink, &quot;When you eat,
                                    don&#39;t say anything, sir. It&#39;s going to be awkward.&quot; Simbok rubbed
                                    father&#39;s back, trying to relieve his cough.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Cough... already... already, Mbok.&quot; We continued
                                    this dinner in silence. No one continued the earlier conversation or started a new
                                    one. Simbok and father have entered the room because it is already ten o&#39;clock
                                    at night. Usually, I sneaked out for dance practice at the Pak Dhe Tuha Studio.
                                    However, I was not there to practice dancing but to say goodbye.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c7"><span class="c6">...</span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Blarongan Studio</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Village By Sari</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">The chanting after chanting of the drums sounded beautiful
                                    and brought this studio to life. This chant could make the heart move and create
                                    beautiful moves. I saw Pakde teaching children my age to dance the Jaranan Buto
                                    dance.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Pakde saw me and called my name, &quot;come here, Lingg. Just
                                    come in.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I did not go to the line but approached Pakde, who was
                                    sitting in his chair not far from the line of dancers.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Thank you, sir. Linga is not here to dance, but
                                    here.&quot; I handed over the buto mask he lent me and the red sampur he gave me
                                    since I studied here.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;That&#39;s fine then, Son. Sir, take the mask. The
                                    sampur is for you.&quot; Pakde took the buto mask and put it on the ground.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;From the start, Pakde knew that your parents didn&#39;t
                                    approve of you dancing, but you have talent, Son. Pakde has forbidden you from
                                    coming here, but you insisted on dancing. Yes, I, let it be.&quot; Pakde stopped and
                                    looked at me, who bent down on his lap. He stroked my head, &quot;Pakde knows you
                                    really like dancing. Dancing has become a part of your life as breathing. Pakde is
                                    willing to let go of a talented child like you.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I said goodbye for the last time. I really didn&#39;t want to
                                    let go of all this. All my dreams were here. I wanted to be like Pakde, who became a
                                    dancer, teaching dance to future successors. So that what Pakde had done was not in
                                    vain in the end. I wanted to open a studio and teach Indonesian dance to the next
                                    generation of this nation. I wanted to, but why? Why should I give up all this? Why
                                    didn&#39;t Simbok and father support me like other parents? Was it because I was a
                                    man? Was it because I shouldn&#39;t dance like a woman? Why? Why was I born a boy?
                                    WHY?!</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">All the way out of the studio, I held back these tears. I
                                    held back my anger. For the last time, I stood in this studio.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c7"><span class="c6">...</span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Banyuwangi was where I was born and where I grew up with its
                                    unique culture. Banyuwangi was famous for its various regional dances that attract
                                    foreign tourists. In the past, studios like Pakde&#39;s studio became a busy place.
                                    Many studios were standing in Banyuwangi. In my village, we only had Sanggar
                                    Blarongan, which one uncle owned. Along with the time, the more forgotten folk
                                    dances. In the past, Pakde said, there were more than five studios in the village of
                                    By Sari, but only Pakde&#39;s studios have survived to this day.</span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">The long bell rang, signaling the end of today&#39;s lesson.
                                    My friends flocked out of the classroom after the teacher said hello. I, who was
                                    still tidying up the books, listened to the conversations of my friends, Ajeng and
                                    Yanti.</span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Yes, I brought it,&quot; answered Yanti. In my heart, I
                                    wondered, &#39;do they want to practice dancing? Isn&#39;t there nothing happening
                                    in Bakungan village? I ventured to ask them.&#39;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;What are you dancing to?&quot; I asked, snatching their
                                    conversation.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Ajeng and Yanti were surprised to hear me asking them.
                                    &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you, Ling. We are dancing for the Gandrung Sewu festival
                                    later.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c6">Gandrung Sewu needs a lot of participants, I thought.
                                    &quot;When is the event?&quot; I asked again. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;About two more months, Ling. The brochure is on the
                                    wall, and there will be a selection before...&quot; Ajeng hadn&#39;t finished her
                                    conversation yet, but I had already started running towards the wall
                                    magazine.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; I said to myself. I saw a red
                                </span><span class="c6">flyer</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;that was pasted. A brochure
                                    that stated, &#39;Gandrung Sewu Festival, looking for 1000 participants, register
                                    your best participants&#39;.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c6">&quot;I promise this is the last time,&quot; I mumbled softly
                                    as I gripped the </span><span class="c6">flyer</span><span
                                    class="c3">&nbsp;tightly.</span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I stopped at the Blarongan, Pakde&#39;s studio. I wanted to
                                    show him this brochure.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Sir, I, I want to dance at this festival. For the last
                                    time,&quot; I said excitedly. Pakde, who was dancing, stopped. He saw me coming and
                                    shouted at him, tired of running. He sat down and called me to sit beside
                                    him.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Come here, Ling.&quot; He put the buto mask beside him
                                    and patted my shoulder, &quot;are you sure? You know the consequences?&quot;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I looked at Pakde sharply with my ambition, &quot;Lingga is
                                    sure, Pakde. Lingga will be responsible for the consequences. Lingga just wants
                                    Pakde to teach Lingga this Gandrung Sewu dance.&quot; I knelt down, &quot;please,
                                    sir, one last time.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Pakde stroked my head and said, &quot;okay, come here tonight
                                    and bring your sampur. We practice. Change your clothes, don&#39;t wear school
                                    clothes. You&#39;ll get dirty.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I couldn&#39;t hide my happy tears. I held my uncle&#39;s
                                    hand. &quot;Thank you, sir. Thank you. Linga has to go first.&quot; I was so happy
                                    that I didn&#39;t want to let go of Pakde&#39;s hand.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Enough, already. Go home, help Simbok.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I replied cheerfully, &quot;Okay, sir.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">That night at Sanggar Blarongan, I felt a strange thing.
                                    Unlike usual, this night was quiet. Not a single drum or gamelan could be heard. I
                                    saw Pakde alone in the middle of the field and a xylophone beside him. I called him
                                    cheerfully, &quot;Sir.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Pakde looked at me, &quot;Come here, Ling.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Unable to bear it, I asked him something strange that I felt,
                                    &quot;Pakde, why aren&#39;t there any children? No one plays drums and gamelan
                                    either.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Pakde replied calmly, &quot;it is specific for you to
                                    practice. Pakde wants to focus on training you.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I nodded silently.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Pakde continued, &quot;You know, in the past, the dancers of
                                    the Gandrung Sewu dance were men who were groomed like women.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I replied, &quot;Lingga knows, sir.&quot; I continued,
                                    &quot;and now, men don&#39;t dance this dance anymore. All were replaced by
                                    women.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Before I spoke again, the sir looked at me. &quot;But dancing
                                    is not just a woman&#39;s job. Men can dance too. Dance whatever they like, say
                                    anything with beautiful dance moves. Dance with your heart. That&#39;s the most
                                    important thing.&quot; Pakde put his hand on my chest, &quot;get ready!&quot;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">This is the time for me to be me. Pakde taught me slowly.
                                    Until I knew one move. Then he would play the xylophone, and I danced.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c7"><span class="c6">...</span></p>
                            <p class="c5"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">My daily routine kept repeating itself. After I went home
                                    from school, I carried goats, cleaned the cage, helped Simbok clean the house, and
                                    at night had dinner together in this bamboo hut. When Simbok had put out the candles
                                    at home, I sneaked out of the house and went to dancing practice at the Pakde Studio
                                    until the day of selection came. Fortunately, the selection day was held on Sunday.
                                    Pakde took me to Baungan village. There we were selected. Luckily, Pakde had an
                                    acquaintance there, Mr. Besro. At first, I was not allowed to join the selection
                                    because I was a boy, but fortunately, after Pak Besro saw me dancing, he changed his
                                    mind. I passed the selection. I was happy. Of course, Pakde asked Pak Besro to judge
                                    me in the room, where the other dancers couldn&#39;t see me. I danced like Pakde
                                    taught me, being myself for the umpteenth time.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">On the way home, I repeatedly thanked Pakde. On this old
                                    motorbike, I felt happy while enjoying the natural beauty of Banyuwangi, which was
                                    starting to darken. We arrived at the village of Oleh Sari. I said goodbye when I
                                    arrived at the Blarongan Studio. When I got home, I saw a lot of people in my house.
                                    The neighbors called me, &quot;son, hurry up, your father!&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c6">Father? Father, why? I ran into the house and went to my
                                    mother who was crying in her room. I saw my father lying on the bed, his breath
                                    panting as he had run around a village. Mother cried beside him. Aware of my
                                    arrival, she ran to weep in my body. With his eyes weakened, father looked at me as
                                    if he wanted to say something. &quot;Ling... according to Simbok&#39;s
                                    words...&quot; Before he finished his last words, he breathed his last. Simbok&#39;s
                                    tears broke, and so did I. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c7"><span class="c6">...</span></p>
                            <p class="c5"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">We had to sell our goats to pay for his tahlilan. Since my
                                    father died, Simbok had taken care of the rice fields. I always wanted to go with
                                    Simbok to the rice fields in the morning, but Simbok always forbade me. Simbok
                                    always told me to go to school. However, Simbok seemed tired of nagging me because
                                    today, Simbok was silent and didn&#39;t scold me for school. I couldn&#39;t bear
                                    seeing Simbok working hard while I didn&#39;t help her in the fields. Taking care of
                                    the fields was a tough job. Simbok must have been tired because she was often sick.
                                    That was why it became irregular, and I often replaced her in the fields.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The days that passed made me realize that I had to bury my
                                    dream of becoming a dancer. I had to replace you and take care of Simbok. It was
                                    getting late. I had to get ready to go home. Simbok was also sick, and I
                                    couldn&#39;t leave her too long. I was ready to go home, and I saw my idol, Pakde
                                    Tuha.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">He came up to me and asked how I was doing, &quot;are you
                                    okay, Ling?&quot; My tears almost spilled. I had failed. I failed to achieve my
                                    dream. I was disappointed, sir. I couldn&#39;t stand it. I kneel to apologize to
                                    him.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Nyuwun pangapunten, sir. I&#39;m sorry. Linga has
                                    failed.&quot; Pakde asked me to get up.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Get up, Ling. Get up.&quot; Pakde held my hand, asking
                                    me to stand up straight, &quot;Lingga, now you have to be strong, stand up straight,
                                    take care of your Simbok and stay who you are.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c12">When we got home, we had dinner together. It seemed that
                                    Simbok&#39;s condition had improved. After eating, I wanted to massage Simbok&#39;s
                                    feet, but Simbok said she was healthy, and the next day, she would go to the fields
                                    again. I was lying in my room. I remembered what Pakde said. </span><span
                                    class="c8">Keep being you</span><span class="c12">. I realized who I was. I realized
                                    I wasn&#39;t being myself and became someone else I didn&#39;t know. I seemed to
                                    borrow someone else&#39;s empty figure. I closed my eyes, and when I opened them
                                    again, I promised myself, &quot;This is my last servant for you and me.&quot; I
                                    checked the date stuck in my closet. There were only two days left for the Gandrung
                                    Sewu celebration to be held. I met Pakde that night and told him my promise. Dancing
                                    at the festival will be the last dance.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c7"><span class="c6">...</span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">That day. Yes, that day was the day that the festival was
                                    held. I said goodbye to Simbok. My heart was racing because I felt guilty to Simbok
                                    for lying with enthusiasm to fulfill my dream one last time, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,
                                    Mbok. Forgive your son. This is the last time.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">In front of this small mirror, I lament this sinful
                                    self.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;I know, I&#39;m not a dutiful child. I&#39;m a sinner,
                                    really. But please give me one last chance to be who I am.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c7"><span class="c6">...</span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">After the festival, I went about my days as usual. Simbok was
                                    rarely sick because I always helped her in the fields, so she didn&#39;t get tired
                                    anymore. Simbok was never angrily telling me to go to school again. Every day I
                                    always accompanied her to the fields. Since our father&#39;s death, our economic
                                    condition had declined, so we had to work hard to be able to eat day after day. I
                                    thought Simbok wouldn&#39;t talk about my education issues, but tonight Simbok
                                    did.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Son, I&#39;m sorry. Because of me, you can&#39;t
                                    continue your school.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I immediately replied, &quot;Simbok doesn&#39;t need to
                                    apologize. Lingga is okay, Mbok. Lingga prefers to help Simbok in the
                                    fields.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Son, it looks like Simbok can&#39;t go to the fields
                                    anymore. Simbok will tell people to take care of our fields. Later we will share
                                    them,&quot; said Simbok.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Simbok, no need. Linga can take care of his fields,
                                    Mbok,&quot; I said softly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Simbok stroked my head, &quot;Simbok got news from Pak Le
                                    that you are in Jakarta. He said he asked you to work in his workshop.&quot; Simbok
                                    continued the conversation, &quot;Simbok will order a ticket to Jakarta. Just get
                                    ready.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">I was shocked by Simbok&#39;s words. How could I leave Simbok
                                    here alone? &quot;But then, who will look after Simbok when Lingga goes to
                                    Jakarta?&quot; I asked worriedly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&quot;Simbok will be fine here. Simbok doesn&#39;t take care
                                    of the fields anymore. So don&#39;t worry.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Half-heartedly I replied, &quot;Okay, Mbok. Lingga will go to
                                    Jakarta.&quot; I couldn&#39;t bear it if I didn&#39;t comply with Simbok&#39;s
                                    request. I didn&#39;t want to be disobedient a second time.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Today I went to Jakarta. In the beauty of the rice fields
                                    that I continued to pass, I also missed all my dreams that were carried by the wind
                                    that greeted me away. A dream that was born in Banyuwangi, and must also be buried
                                    in this land.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p>
