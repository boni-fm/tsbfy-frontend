                                    Lately, my life </span><span class="c11">had</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;been
                                    exhausting since everything around me is mostly
                                    unpleasant, from the most trivial things to crucial matters that could be compared
                                    to obligations. I took a
                                    stroll without thinking of a particular destination, just walking whenever my mind
                                    wanted to go. One of the
                                    streets I passed was strange yet familiar at the same time. Probably the last time I
                                    saw this street was
                                    long ago when I could not exactly pinpoint the exact time. Buildings were still
                                    placed as they used to
                                    though some buildings changed their use. As I remembered, the yellow-painted small
                                    shop located in front of
                                    the park was someone&rsquo;s house back then. The park still retains its original
                                    look. The seesaw looked
                                    strong like it&rsquo;s newly bought. The swing appeared colorfully vibrant, and,
                                    last but not least, the
                                    slide showed no paint chips or rust found. I was wondering how the park could be
                                    extremely retained despite
                                    its age. That person who had been looking after the park for many years did an
                                    extremely amazing job.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After looking around the park, I almost mindlessly walked to
                                    another destination I
                                    did not think of. A cafe with a beige-painted front view with a letter-shaped light
                                    caught my eye because I
                                    felt thirsty after taking a long walk from the bus stop. Also, I needed to sit and
                                    view pleasant-looking
                                    interiors to enhance my restful stop. By glancing at the menu board near the
                                    entrance door, it seemed that
                                    this cafe serves tasty desserts and beverages. It was true because, as soon as I
                                    arrive, the seats are
                                    mostly occupied by people. Goodness, I finally found an unoccupied seat located near
                                    the window, which was
                                    my favorite spot if I went on my own because, whenever I went to a cafe, I could
                                    look outside whenever I got
                                    bored. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;One piece of red velvet
                                    cake and one
                                    medium-sized bubble tea&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c6">The person who served me looked familiar, and I thought she
                                    was one of my elementary
                                    school friends. Some of my elementary school friends had similar facial features
                                    back then. Two of them were
                                    identical twins, and I had trouble telling them apart except for their names, Bulan
                                    and Bintang. They were
                                    rather calm. The other pair of my friends who looked uncannily similar often act
                                    like Tom and Jerry as if
                                    they were actual siblings. Coincidentally, their first names were Jasmine. Everyone
                                    called both Jasmines by
                                    their middle name. I suddenly remembered that one boy who always pranked the whole
                                    class, Eugene, was dared
                                    to read a silly love poem in front of the class after he made one of my friends cry,
                                    which caused him. That
                                    girl became a so-called couple in the class too. Despite remembering what happened
                                    at that time, I could not
                                    exactly pinpoint the name of that girl until I saw her name tag, which says
                                </span><span class="c3">Kara</span><span class="c6">. Ah, Kara was that girl who often
                                    cried in class, and she once got
                                    &lsquo;rescued&rsquo; by a silly love poem. She got along with me very well, and she
                                    gave me a letter before
                                    the day she transferred to another school. The reason why she moved remains unknown
                                    until that day, she
                                    didn&rsquo;t even give a clue in her handwritten letter. It had been known that the
                                    world was surely a
                                    strange place. People could encounter old friends or other people&rsquo;s friends in
                                    unexpected places, just
                                    like my recent encounter with Kara.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c4">I smiled at Kara after she finished serving me, and she
                                    smiled back. From her facial
                                    expressions, it looked like she recognized me as her childhood friend. However, she
                                    might smile as a part of
                                    her job to greet customers warmly. From what I knew, she had been a welcoming and
                                    friendly person since the
                                    day we became friends when we were in elementary school. She got along with all of
                                    my classmates. She once
                                    suggested the whole class play hide-and-seek together, and everyone agreed. When
                                    Benny, the seeker, counted
                                    up to fifty, Kara and I hid together inside the treehouse on the playground. It was
                                    not clever to hide there
                                    since the treehouse had an open window that we forgot to close. We enjoyed looking
                                    at the surroundings until
                                    we forgot about the hide-and-seek game we were playing. Luckily, we were not chosen
                                    as the seeker as someone
                                    else was caught earlier than us. As I stayed inside the other hiding spot, I met
                                    Kara and her friends, Dee
                                    and Via.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s her again.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c4">Inside the hiding spot, we played lots of games, such as
                                    rock-scissors-paper, truth
                                    or dare, and more games that I could not remember because we changed the game a few
                                    minutes after we started
                                    apart from the two games I mentioned. Unlike the previous one, we forgot about the
                                    hide-and-seek game, but
                                    we did not get caught. We spent our time playing truth or dare for hours.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3 c7">&quot;Let&#39;s spin the bottle again. Who turns
                                    next?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c4">It was Kara&#39;s turn to did what their friends chose, truth
                                    or dare. Dee, Via, and
                                    I agreed collectively to assign Kara to tell any truth that she hasn&#39;t told
                                    everyone yet about herself.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3 c7">&quot;Come on, tell us a secret. We promise we won&#39;t
                                    spill it to everyone
                                    else. Every truth told in this game stays here.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c4">I was trying to convince Kara to convey her thoughts. Every
                                    person who has known Kara
                                    said she is very amiable. She rarely told secrets, even to her closest friends and
                                    family. She played
                                    joyfully around us, as if we lived in a happy, safe place. On this occasion, Kara
                                    looked like she wanted to
                                    announce something important.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3 c7">&ldquo;Guys, perhaps this month is going to be my last
                                    month in this school. I am
                                    going to move to another school next month because of my dad&rsquo;s job. Do you
                                    guys remember when I was
                                    that new kid at school in second grade? I was scared of not being able to make
                                    friends because that happened
                                    in my old school. I stayed for only a year and a half there. I hoped I could stay
                                    longer here, but
                                    it&rsquo;s almost the same. Now, we&rsquo;re at the beginning of fourth grade.
                                    It&rsquo;s been a happy time
                                    spending with you guys for two years, especially around you three. I will announce
                                    it to the whole class
                                    next week, at the beginning of August. Also, I would like to give a farewell letter
                                    so we can stay in
                                    touch.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c6">We all put our attention to Kara&rsquo;s message. Everyone is
                                    feeling sad since it
                                    was almost Kara&rsquo;s farewell. An hour passed, and no one found them in their
                                    hiding place. Probably they
                                    forgot there were four players left still hiding somewhere.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fast forward to the beginning of August, she announced her
                                    message before she moved
                                    to another school on the next day. I was curious as to what was the true reason
                                    behind her moving to another
                                    school beside her father&rsquo;s job. My gut said there must be another reason why
                                    she moved out all of a
                                    sudden. Usually, people transfer schools in the second semester, at least in this
                                    school. There had been
                                    three, including Kara, who transferred into another school. The first two were the
                                    twins named Bulan and
                                    Bintang. They moved to Australia because their father worked for an embassy. We
                                    still contacted each other
                                    up to that day, and we even hung out once in a while. Currently they were already
                                    back in Indonesia. For
                                    Kara, no one knew her whereabouts for sure until I graduated elementary
                                    school.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next day, I asked Lila, one of my friends, to accompany
                                    me to the cafe I visited
                                    the day before. We chit-chatted about things, from each other&rsquo;s whereabouts,
                                    hottest gossip, and more
                                    miscellaneous things we cannot name them. Lila whispered at me,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That Kara girl looks like my neighbor.&rdquo;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that I asked about the Kara she talked about. She said
                                    that her neighbor passed
                                    away a few days after their elementary school graduation. I was extremely shocked.
                                    None of my elementary
                                    school friends knew about this, even Dee and Via. They could not keep in touch with
                                    Kara despite their
                                    efforts, but she did not answer their calls, texts, and even emails. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was quite close to Kara until her very end. She was
                                    that new kid in fourth
                                    grade in my school. She told me she often transferred schools every two years
                                    because of her father&rsquo;s
                                    job. She hopes to stay enrolled at the same school until graduation day. She did not
                                    want to move again
                                    because she had moved schools four times throughout her young age. Unfortunately, an
                                    accident took her life
                                    away several days after graduation&rdquo;.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That Kara girl who worked in a cafe wasn&rsquo;t my childhood
                                    friend, it was probably
                                    a lookalike who shared her name. I was sorry for what happened after elementary
                                    graduation day. Thank you
                                    for making my elementary school days happy, although we cannot meet again here.
                                    Sometimes, childhood friends
                                    made the best memories, and Kara was one of the best ones out of all the joyful
                                    moments I experienced.
                                    Remembering childhood friends had that certain feeling I couldn&rsquo;t describe in
                                    words, but the only
                                    thing I could do was hope they were doing well if completely out of touch.</span>
