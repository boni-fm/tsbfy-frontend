                            <p class="c9"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the
                                    nineteenth century in the
                                    countryside of England, where a young beautiful girl of twenty two named Helena
                                    Collins lives with her
                                    family. She is the first daughter of Mr. Henry Collins and Mrs. Susan Collins, and
                                    the twelve-year-old
                                    Olivia Collins is the only one sister of her. On this bright summer morning, Helena
                                    and Olivia look very
                                    jolly while they are playing with their lovely dogs. A couple of golden retrievers
                                    seem very enthusiastic to
                                    catch the balls that Olivia throws in the yard. They will pursue, catch the ball by
                                    their mouth, and give it
                                    back to her. While Olivia and two golden retrievers happily run around, Helena just
                                    sits on the white swing
                                    and watches them. She has a pale complexion with long golden brown hair. She lets
                                    her long hair hang loose
                                    with some of the left and right side tied in the back. Light gray is her eyes color.
                                    It is round and filled
                                    with long and curling eyelashes. Smiles and laughs come now and then in her lips
                                    when she looks into her
                                    sister or to the two little puppies that sit on her lap. They are very adorable and
                                    this cuteness
                                    can&rsquo;t make her stop caressing them. Every once in a while she will kiss them.
                                    It pleases her heart
                                    even more. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This makes Helena think that the house where she was born and
                                    lives in has provided
                                    much warmth and happiness for her. But in fact, there are some reasons that make her
                                    want to flee away from
                                    here. Sometimes this place is really suffocating her until she thinks that it is
                                    better for her to not live
                                    in this house. Helena&rsquo;s father, Mr. Henry Collins is someone who is prone to
                                    outbursts of rage when
                                    his mood is not really good. He is a short-tempered and authoritative man. When
                                    something doesn&#39;t suit
                                    him, he will be so upset. On the contrary, in this house, no one dares to criticize
                                    him or they will get
                                    scolded back. Helena truly hates this kind of behavior of her father. She has been
                                    through something like
                                    this all her life. To be sure, her mother has experienced this much longer than
                                    her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c8">Helena realizes that her mother, Mrs. Susan Collins, is the
                                    most patient and
                                    indulgent person in the world. She is able to endure to always stay by her
                                    husband&#39;s side. Mrs. Collins
                                    always excuses Mr. Collin&rsquo;s behavior, and she will say to her daughters
                                </span><span class="c3">&lsquo;that is how your Papa is, my dearest&rsquo;. </span><span
                                    class="c0">Helena believes that
                                    she doesn&rsquo;t completely take after her mother. Of course her father&rsquo;s
                                    blood runs through her body
                                    as well. That is why she is not a truly patient and tender girl like Mrs. Collins.
                                    She can not blame anyone
                                    for this reason. After all, Mr. Collins still has much affection for them. He is a
                                    responsible man as well.
                                    Helena loves her father very much since he is actually a kind and loving person. But
                                    when he turns to show
                                    his temper, it is the worst for her and she doesn&#39;t like this at all. It makes
                                    her suffocate and she is
                                    really sick of this kind of situation. She is afraid that this hate feeling will
                                    always come for such a
                                    situation. He is still her father and she won&rsquo;t hate him at all. She wishes
                                    that this bad behavior of
                                    her father will disappear, but perhaps it is impossible. By all the moments Helena
                                    experienced until now, it
                                    makes her realize that someday she only wants to meet a man who is very kind,
                                    gentle, and affectionate,
                                    without a temper like her father. &nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Helena is still in her own thoughts while caressing the
                                    two puppies, she catches
                                    sight of her mother and Aunt Martha, the housekeeper, who come closer to her.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Helena, Mrs. Tinsley said that Mr. Davies is here. He
                                    has just arrived at his
                                    house.&rdquo; Aunt Martha informs her enthusiastically. Knowing this, Helena&rsquo;s
                                    eyes start to
                                    gleam.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to see him, Helen?&rdquo; Her
                                    mother asks her while
                                    taking one of the puppies from Helena&rsquo;s lap. She hugs and kisses it.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really? It&rsquo;s been a while.&rdquo; Helena
                                    responses. She is standing and
                                    carrying the puppy by her arms. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">William Davies is an old friend of Helena. His father is
                                    Scottish but his mother is
                                    English. When he was seventeen, he and his family moved to England. At that time,
                                    Helena was only twelve.
                                    William Davies has a younger brother named Bryan Davies. He is two years younger
                                    than William. They three
                                    then became close friends since they lived nearby. However, Helena was closer to
                                    William as slowly she began
                                    to love him. William is a handsome man who is very loving and gentle. Helena really
                                    loves how this man
                                    treats her. She sees William as the man she has been looking for since he is not a
                                    man with a short-temper
                                    like her father. He is very kind, calm, and affectionate. And Bryan is actually the
                                    same.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not only Helena, William actually also has the same feeling
                                    for her. However, for
                                    some reason, their relationship was only a couple of friends who are caring and
                                    loving each other. Helena is
                                    a girl so she thinks that it is not appropriate to express her own feelings to the
                                    man she loves directly.
                                    And for William, he never says that he loves Helena. Somehow they keep their
                                    feelings very well.
                                    Unfortunately, while their relationship grows closer, when William was twenty two,
                                    William and all his
                                    family had to move back to Scotland because his grandfather died. The house here is
                                    still inhabited by the
                                    maid, Mrs. Tinsley. During four years after their move, it is only William who comes
                                    to England and visits
                                    Helena for twice or more a year. He also often sends her a letter. However, for more
                                    than one year, William
                                    never comes. So when Helena knows that he comes to visit, she feels very happy. Then
                                    Helena, accompanied by
                                    Olivia, comes to his old house. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They walk down the street until they arrive at a large house.
                                    This house is dominated
                                    by brick red with many large white windows. It is surrounded by a low iron fence. In
                                    the entrance, there is
                                    a path straight to the house in which on the left and right side is planted with
                                    many beautiful roses.
                                    Helena believes that Mrs. Tinsley takes good care of this house very much. The
                                    garden looks very fancy since
                                    it is decorated by many beautiful flowers. She always reminisces about her old
                                    memories with William and
                                    Bryan when she comes to this house. When they enter the backyard, Helena and Olivia
                                    see a woman and a man
                                    who are standing back to them. Helena guesses that they are Mrs. Tinsley and
                                    William. Then they approach
                                    them.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mrs. Tinsley&hellip; William&hellip;&rdquo; Helena
                                    greets them. Then they turn
                                    around. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Helena&hellip;&rdquo; The man in front of her is
                                    smiling. But the smile on
                                    Helena&rsquo;s lips slowly faded. It is not William.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;U-uh&hellip; S-sorry. You&hellip; you&hellip;&rdquo;
                                    She stammers since it is
                                    a bit awkward. Helena tilts her head. She feels familiar with this face.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bryan/Bryan&rdquo; Helena and Bryan exclaim together.
                                    Then they hug each
                                    other. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time, Helen.&rdquo; Bryan
                                    mumbles behind her shoulder.
                                    Then they break the embrace.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bryan, you change a lot.&rdquo; Helena stares at his
                                    face.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So do you, Helena. You have grown up and look very
                                    lovely.&rdquo; Helena just
                                    chuckles lightly hearing him.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, Bryan. I thought it was William, but it is
                                    actually you, Bryan Davies.
                                    I don&rsquo;t expect it at all.&rdquo; Bryan just smiles.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh Mrs. Tinsley, Aunt Martha didn&rsquo;t tell me that
                                    it was Bryan who came
                                    to visit. She only said that Mr. Davies had arrived. So I guessed that it was
                                    William since he is the one
                                    who often comes to this house.&rdquo; Helena explains eagerly while holding Mrs.
                                    Tinsley&rsquo;s hands.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My dear. You really miss him, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
                                    Mrs. Tinsley stares and
                                    smiles at her tenderly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s been a while since he came
                                    here.&rdquo; Helena answers
                                    her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who is this little girl?&rdquo; Bryan shifts his
                                    attention to Olivia who had
                                    only been listening to the conversation of people in front of her. He bends over and
                                    caresses her
                                    head.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is Olivia, my little sister.&rdquo; Helena answers
                                    his question. Hearing
                                    this, Bryan lifts up his head and stares at Helena&rsquo;s face. He is frowning, but
                                    then he stares back at
                                    Olivia.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello, Mr. Bryan. I&rsquo;m Olivia. You&rsquo;re as
                                    handsome as Mr.
                                    William.&rdquo; Olivia says it brightly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really? You are good at praising.&rdquo; He comments
                                    with a giggle and pulls
                                    himself up.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah. I have met him several times.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So this is our first meeting, right?&rdquo; He asks
                                    again while folding his
                                    arms across his chest.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m very happy to see you, Mr. Bryan. And I
                                    think Helena too,
                                    isn&#39;t it?&rdquo; Olivia raises her head and stares at Helena.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, certainly.&rdquo; Helena answers her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that right? But I&rsquo;m not really sure since she
                                    came here to meet
                                    William, and not me.&rdquo; Bryan says. It makes all of them laugh.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Olivia, I want to make some pies. Would you like to
                                    help me?&rdquo; Mrs.
                                    Tinsley asks Olivia.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure, Mrs. Tinsley. I really love pie.&rdquo; Olivia
                                    answers her
                                    eagerly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright. Let&rsquo;s come with me and leave these two
                                    people to have a
                                    talk.&rdquo; Mrs. Tinsley says while chuckling and taking Olivia&rsquo;s hand. They
                                    leave Helena and Bryan
                                    in the backyard.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How are you doing, Helena?&rdquo; After a few moments
                                    of silence, Bryan asks
                                    her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m good. I&rsquo;m really good. You? How about
                                    you?&rdquo; Helena feels
                                    rather clumsy.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not bad.&rdquo; Bryan answers her briefly. Then he
                                    guides her to take a seat
                                    on a bench.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Olivia&hellip;&rdquo; Bryan says hesitantly.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She is my stepsister.&rdquo; Helena explains as if she
                                    knows what is on his
                                    head. Bryan is a bit stunned.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A year after you left this house, my father took
                                    Olivia home. She was so
                                    little and adorable. He said that she is his own other daughter and would be my
                                    sister too. I believe that
                                    it was really hurtful for my mother knowing this truth. She said that Olivia&rsquo;s
                                    mother has died so she
                                    would be her mother too. At first, I couldn&#39;t accept her presence. But seeing my
                                    mother&rsquo;s love and
                                    sincerity, I realize that there is no use for hating someone. My mother gives her
                                    much love. I just want to
                                    do the same thing too.&rdquo; She pauses for a moment. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is on my father&rsquo;s head.
                                    He always asks me to
                                    love my stepsister, but himself even has a bad relationship with his own sister,
                                    Aunt Vivian.&rdquo; Helena
                                    adds with a sigh.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know exactly how you feel.&rdquo; Bryan stares at
                                    Helena with a smile and
                                    clasps her hand.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She is a good girl. And you are a kind sister for her.
                                    I believe that your
                                    kindness is as much as your mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Bryan states.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that good. I believe that I can&rsquo;t
                                    put up with such a
                                    condition of married life.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No. You will not. You will never experience that. I
                                    believe that you will have
                                    a happier one.&rdquo; He says earnestly to convince her. They look at each other and
                                    smile.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I hope so, Bryan. So, why did you just come after five
                                    years? It was always
                                    William who came to visit.&rdquo; Helena starts to change the topic.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;William came here only to see you, Helen. And I think
                                    my reason to be here is
                                    the same.&rdquo; Helena frowns when she hears him. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Helena, do you still love William?&rdquo; She is a bit
                                    surprised with the
                                    question.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;W-why did you ask that?&rdquo; Helena gives him a
                                    question back. She feels
                                    ashamed.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Helena, I know that you love him, so did William. He
                                    said to me that he loves
                                    you very much and he wants to marry you. He wants you to always be happy. Please,
                                    don&rsquo;t fill your mind
                                    with grief. You can also share everything with me to ease your mind.&rdquo; Bryan
                                    pauses and stares at
                                    Helena who only hangs her head in silence.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Helen, look at me,&rdquo; Bryan holds Helena&rsquo;s
                                    hands tightly. She then
                                    lifts her head and looks at Bryan&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Please forgive William
                                    because he never confesses to
                                    you. But, you have to know that he does really love you. He always tries to be your
                                    best company. He will
                                    not let you be alone and feel sad. A-and, and so do I. I do have the same feeling
                                    too.&rdquo; He explains
                                    slowly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y-you, you what?&rdquo; Hearing Bryan&rsquo;s words,
                                    her eyes start to be
                                    filled with tears. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip; I love you, Helena. I&rsquo;m sorry, I have
                                    never experienced such a
                                    feeling before. When I knew the fact that you love him more, I just tried to get
                                    over this feeling. But I
                                    think I still keep it in my heart.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bryan&hellip;&rdquo; Helena tries to interrupt
                                    him.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, Helen. Just listen to me first. I will explain to
                                    you.&rdquo; He
                                    continues. &ldquo;William was sick.&rdquo; He pauses. His eyes look very sad and his
                                    lips trembling. Helena
                                    seems fidgety.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He has had a serious heart condition since he was a
                                    child. When we moved here
                                    and we met, he told me that he wanted to keep his disease a secret. He didn&rsquo;t
                                    want to tell you and
                                    make you sad. So he always tried to be alright in front of you. He realized that he
                                    loved you, but he
                                    didn&rsquo;t want to confess to you since he was afraid that he couldn&rsquo;t
                                    always be with you and would
                                    just leave you alone in this world. He wanted to marry you but he
                                    couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He pauses
                                    again.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He was very strong. He had struggled with the illness
                                    for a very long time.
                                    But sadly, one year ago, he gave in to his life. He passed away.&rdquo; Bryan tells
                                    the truth. His heavy
                                    tears streamed down. So does Helena.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;N-no&hellip; d-don&rsquo;t fool around with me, Bryan.
                                    You&#39;re lying. Even
                                    the last time we met he said that he wanted to take me to Scotland. To his
                                    home.&rdquo; Helena sobs and
                                    becomes increasingly restless. She tries to deny Bryan&rsquo;s explanation.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not lying. I will take you to Scotland
                                    to see the truth.&rdquo;
                                    Bryan pulls her into his arms. He hugs her tightly between her sobs. Helena&rsquo;s
                                    sob sounds very hurtful
                                    for Bryan. All this time, Helena just knows that there is no something wrong with
                                    William. She never knows
                                    that he has suffered a lot. He always soothed and consoled her when she was
                                    distressed. Helena even once
                                    imagined living happily with William, but now it is only a dream and an impossible
                                    thing. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next day, Bryan and Helena off to Scotland. There, Bryan
                                    brings her to a
                                    cemetery, to meet William. It truly suffocates her knowing the truth that William
                                    has passed away. She can
                                    not see him anymore. Only a tombstone which becomes evidence that William has been
                                    resting peacefully. If
                                    Helena could repeat the time, she would say to William that she loves him very much.
                                    Now, Helena is just
                                    trying to accept the reality that William is not her fate. Helena can not hold back
                                    her tears. Bryan just
                                    stands next to her silently, then he gives her a letter. He says that it was a
                                    letter from William for her.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Through this letter, William expresses his feelings. If he
                                    can, he will stay by her
                                    side for a long time, marry her, and give her nothing but happiness. However, he
                                    thinks that he is not
                                    capable of doing that. William is really grateful and glad to meet a girl like her.
                                    Helena becomes a reason
                                    for him to survive. When he is not here anymore, he will not leave her alone.
                                    William wants Bryan to marry
                                    her. He believes that Bryan will give her much love. Bryan will protect and cherish
                                    her. William will be
                                    glad if his wish comes true. Hope Helena will have a happier life after this. She is
                                    overcome with emotion
                                    and confusion. Helena folds the letter and raises her head. She stares at
                                    Bryan&rsquo;s eyes. Helena
                                    believes that Bryan has known about this. He gives a faint smile and they hug each
                                    other. Helena can not
                                    make the decision for now.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two weeks after their return from Scotland, Bryan proposes to
                                    her. Helena has
                                    carefully thought about it. She believes that Bryan can give her much happiness. She
                                    can see that this man
                                    truly loves her. Then Helena decides to accept his proposal. Bryan looks very happy.
                                    Helena realizes that it
                                    is useless to lament her past. She wants her future to be happier and she believes
                                    that Bryan is the one she
                                    needs. She will fly away to pursue her happiness with someone she loves. Helena
                                    trusts him and she will love
                                    him as much as he loves her because for now she only hopes that the future life of
                                    her and this man is
                                    having a very happy married life.</span></p>
