                SOME people were not familiar
                        with who they met, talked, and what they did every minute. Let&rsquo;s say it was something that
                        was out of control, or they didn&rsquo;t care about anything around them. That&rsquo;s possible.
                        Jihan wasa girl that always thought that she was in a wonderland because she had never once felt
                        or experienced what she was experiencing right now. She felt happy, so happy. It was quite
                        strange that people around her sometimes didn&rsquo;t see that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jihan smiled right away when she
                        saw her childhood-neighbor best friend stepping into the bus that she was in. Why was she
                        smiling? It was easy. She had been having a big crush on him forever, and people knew about that
                        because she kind of showed it in public. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, joyfriend.&rdquo;
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, they called each other
                        joyfriend.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My joyfriend Janu!&rdquo;
                        Jihan greeted him. She looked happy as usual. &ldquo;Oh. Woah! Have you got a new phone?
                        That&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janu nodded and smiled without
                        saying anything. Janu was a shy, introverted, and calm person, so nothing new if he acted that
                        way. Everybody knew it. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">The
                        passengers in the bus with them started looking at Jihan for some reason, and Jihan realized
                        that they all were looking at her with their weird glaze. </span><span class="c3">Is my voice
                        too loud? </span><span class="c1">She asks herself, but she forgot about it and started not
                        giving a deal with it. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is everybody here looking
                        at me, or I&rsquo;m tripping?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janu frowned. &ldquo;Really? A
                        star syndrome in a bus? You&rsquo;re kidding, Jihan.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, c&rsquo;mon! Do I have
                        something on my face?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Nope, you look
                        okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh my god! Why are people
                        so intimidating?&rdquo; Jihan sighed because she thought that she had a problem with herself.
                        She couldn&rsquo;t do literally anything freely in public. At the end of the day, she made every
                        little thing a big deal for her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry for talking too
                        much. I&rsquo;m afraid people will judge me. Oh, they definitely are!&rdquo; She added.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just don&rsquo;t mind
                        them.&rdquo; Janu gave her a pat on her shoulder.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I
                        will.&rdquo;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">THE day continues. These best friends would sit in front of Jihan&rsquo;s house
                        to talk about everything for hours. Just like that time. They were sitting side by side and
                        facing their neighbors&rsquo; houses. Jihan was always grateful if they both had time together,
                        even though they always do. It&rsquo;s Jihan&rsquo;s happiness to be with Janu in her free time.
                        For some reason, she felt at home if she was with Janu and didn&rsquo;t feel the same way when
                        she&rsquo;s with her family. Her family, especially her dad, hated her for so long, and Jihan
                        didn&rsquo;t know why until now. People around here would say that she was a crazy girl because
                        she always spent time alone. At that moment, Jihan would find herself saying, </span><span
                        class="c3">alone? </span><span class="c1">Because she thought she was not. Of course, she had
                        Janu.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Do you think I can move
                        out of this house, Janu?&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Jihan
                        hitted Janu&rsquo;s hand and then laughed. The last time she felt happy was about six years ago
                        when she and Janu went on a vacation together with their family. She didn&rsquo;t understand why
                        they never hung out anymore like that time. Besides the family hatred towards her, they
                        could&rsquo;ve just hung out together, both of them. Janu had never said anything to Jihan when
                        she talked about how she had been wanting to go on a vacation together. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Jihan!&rdquo; A neighbor
                        of theirs that was the same age walked down the street with a bag on her shoulder. It seemed
                        like she just got home from somewhere.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, hi, Mel!&rdquo;
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing,
                        sitting there? It&rsquo;s almost nine p.m.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Talking?&rdquo; Jihan
                        answered and got confused.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like&hellip; on the
                        phone?&rdquo; Mel asked again. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, with Ja-&rdquo; before
                        Jihan answered, Mel cutted off the conversation by saying that she had to go because her mom
                        needed her. Both Jihan said bye to Mel. Jihan smiled a second later after seeing Janu said bye
                        to Mel as well, because she knew everybody knew that Janu wasn&rsquo;t that easy-going. He did
                        say bye even though it&rsquo;s only a bye. </span><span class="c3">Why was he being
                        weird?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s Jihan&rsquo;s second
                        time catched people looking at her while talking. &nbsp;She had no idea what&rsquo;s going on,
                        but she thought people were weird these days.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">THREE days later, again, Jihan spent time with Janu. Both of them would never get
                        tired of spending time together because they were just comfortable with each other. Strange
                        things kept coming. Jihan notices that people always looked at her when she was out of the house
                        minding her own business. Meanwhile, her parents always yelled and said that she was a crazy
                        girl that lived in their house. She didn&#39;t understand. </span><span class="c3 c6">Why do
                        people look at me that way? Why do my parents say I&rsquo;m crazy? </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being
                        self-centered, but do you know why people are staring at me, and my parents say that I&rsquo;m a
                        crazy girl, Janu?&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You will keep talking
                        about that?&rdquo; Janu looked at Jihan.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah because it just keeps
                        getting weird, you know?&rdquo; Jihan sighed. It&rsquo;s been hard for Jihan. People weirdly
                        looked at her, got scolded by her parents every day, and got called crazy by them. She was just
                        pissed off, but she couldn&rsquo;t do anything about that. &ldquo;If you want me not to think
                        about it, well, I do want to, but I feel sad.&rdquo; She added.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re just
                        pretty.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, c&rsquo;mon! People
                        would not look at me with their weird-scary gaze if I&rsquo;m pretty. And my parents saying
                        I&rsquo;m crazy? That&rsquo;s not possible.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janu giggled. Seeing Janu&rsquo;s
                        smile always made Jihan happy. Let&rsquo;s say that was the only thing that kept Jihan happy and
                        alive.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;But, you are, though.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh. Woah, thanks,
                        joyfriend.&rdquo; Jihan smiled.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&ldquo;But, isn&#39;t it weird that they only look at me. I repeat. Only me, not
                        you.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Janu
                        shrugged. Jihan continued eating her hotdog, tried to forget it. They sat in front of
                        Jihan&rsquo;s house again, ate and talked. Not long after that, Jihan&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s car
                        came into the yard. Her father came home from somewhere. Jihan had no idea what her father did
                        outside because she never talked to her father. After all, he hated her, and so did Jihan.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jihan tried not to make eye
                        contact with her father when he got out of the car with his bag on his shoulder. </span><span
                        class="c3 c6">He looks scary. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not wrong to
                        say you&rsquo;re crazy.&rdquo; That was Jihan&rsquo;s father.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jihan frowned. &ldquo;What do you
                        mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Her
                        father looked back when he was about to open the door.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy. You have a problem with your mind or whatever.
                        Don&rsquo;t you know that? You know what? I don&rsquo;t want to have a crazy daughter like you,
                        if you want to know. You&rsquo;re crazy, and so sick of you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course, you would
                        answer with &lsquo;what do you mean? &lsquo;Excuse me?&rsquo;. You&rsquo;re a crazy girl. I hope
                        you know that.&rdquo; Jihan&rsquo;s father slammed the door.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Oh wow.
                </span><span class="c1">Jihan&rsquo;s father never talked that much to Jihan. Once he did, he broke
                        Jihan&rsquo;s heart into pieces. At this point, she didn&rsquo;t even have the energy to cry.
                        Instead, she questioned a lot in her mind. She didn&#39;t get how her father kept saying
                        she&rsquo;s crazy. She had no clue at all. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janu looked at her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I am. Don&rsquo;t worry. I
                        don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s
                        so-&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I know right?&rdquo; Jihan
                        continued. She knows what Janu was talking about.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Again,
                        Jihan didn&rsquo;t understand why she kept getting this so much. She had never done anything
                        bad, and she had good grades. At least that was what parents wanted for their children. Right?
                </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minutes later, the door opened.
                        Her father was there again with the gaze that Jihan understood. </span><span class="c3">Oh,
                        he&rsquo;s about to yell again. </span><span class="c1">She mentally prepared. She knew she
                        would get called crazy or stuff again. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you seriously
                        crazy?!&rdquo; Jihan&rsquo;s father asked. His voice rised. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Dad, listen. I&rsquo;ve
                        never fought you or whatsoever all this time. When you called me crazy, I accepted that. So now,
                        I don&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re talking about. Why do you keep calling me crazy?! Oh
                        my god.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jihan&rsquo;s father looked at
                        Jihan with disgust. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re screaming at me? Are you dumb?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Why are you&hellip;-No why
                        do you always call me crazy? Why do you hate me so much?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;BECAUSE YOU ARE
                        CRAZY!&rdquo; Jihan&rsquo;s father yelled. &ldquo;Do you know that you always talk to someone
                        that we can&rsquo;t see? You&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jihan frowned. She clearly
                        didn&rsquo;t understand what her father was talking about. </span><span class="c3 c6">Talking to
                        someone you can&rsquo;t see?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&#65279;</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;What do ymean?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I hate you so much
                        for always being a crazy daughter, talking to a ghost or whatever, calling Janu&rsquo;s name
                        like he&rsquo;s still here. Are you crazy? He died three years ago, and you&rsquo;re telling me
                        you talk to him all this time?!&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jihan sat limply on the floor
                        right away. She couldn&rsquo;t believe what she just heard. She was so sure that Janu had been
                        there with her. She was still sure. But then again, that time, she realized that she
                        hallucinates. Janu has not been here since three years ago.</span></p>
