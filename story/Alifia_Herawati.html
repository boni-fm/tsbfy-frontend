            <p>
                It was bleak. And plain. And boring. Not like she cared about it, though. It has just
            started to get very annoying and pathetic, if she could be honest. The thing was, she couldn&#39;t even be
            honest to her friends about this. What was it? Loneliness? If that was dramatic, boredom? Whenever she was
            being asked, her answer remained the same. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I have my own happiness.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her friends would roll their eyes, &quot;and that is?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c4">She would give them her K-Pop idols&#39; merchandise in front of their faces, or talk
            about her </span><span class="c4">favorite</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;book&#39;s characters for hours. And
            they sighed, loudly even. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You know, isolating yourself will lead to frustration.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The first time she heard it, she was stunned because she didn&#39;t think it was an
            act of isolation. But as time passed by, she could understand their point of view.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s not a form of isolation. It&#39;s just me setting proper
            boundaries.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, human&#39;s nature is to socialize in real life with each other. Do tell
            us, are you satisfied by just gratifying yourself with fiction? Are you genuinely happy with
            that?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Those were the regular questions she didn&#39;t dare to answer every time. She would
            just shrug or snort before changing the subject. And this always happened like a circle. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">She found it ironic that her life lately is being determined by a cycle of tiredness
            built in her mind, self, and feelings. She couldn&#39;t get rid of her unknown annoyance that grew even
            bigger. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It&#39;s not like she was gradually deteriorating or vanishing from her real life.
            She just felt empty and pointless in this state. She&#39;s been working from day to night, doing work, doing
            homework, and doing anything normal for a human being according to her beliefs. But why, why indeed. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It felt helpless. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But alas, the Lord is caring, loving, and merciful. He surely won&#39;t make his
            creatures feel hopeless for too long, so he sent a saviour for this poor woman. A saviour in which she
            almost detested at the first glance. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Socialising wasn&#39;t really her thing. In fact, she avoided it most of the time,
            which is probably one of her sources of the existential problems mentioned before. She didn&#39;t hate it,
            almost, maybe. But not a certainty. Besides, hate was a strong word. She just performed better without
            having to do it. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">At least that&#39;s what she thought until her one close friend offered a position in
            a short event. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Come on. It won&#39;t last long! Probably just for two or three weeks,&quot;
            persuaded her friend. She wasn&#39;t contemplated enough, but it sure raised her interest. Two or three
            weeks only, including its preparation. It was really short. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I doubt it. It requires working under pressure with so many strangers. It must
            be very stressful.&quot; She tried to reject and deny that she was already slightly intrigued. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh yeah, it is. But it won&#39;t be so bad. I couldn&#39;t guarantee if it
            would entertain you or not. I&#39;m a hundred percent sure it will be meaningful, at least for someone who
            dislikes crowds like you because it involves dealing with books.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">She paid her attention fully to her friend. &quot;What kind of event?&quot; She
            asked. Her friend&#39;s face lit up for a second. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Volunteer. Aaaaaand you don&#39;t have to prepare too much. Just say yes, and
            you&#39;ll be assigned to the distribution committee immediately.&quot; She raised her eyes, signaling the
            opposite woman to explain more. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Uh, what else to say? I genuinely think that it would be great to try. Sure, we
            will not be paid but volunteering for others who need our help, why not, right?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You could define distributing things&mdash; with books, perhaps?&quot; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And her friend understood. She began to hear about the vision of this event. Its
            expected results as her interest and excitement grew bigger. </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Alright, it&#39;s enough. I understand.&quot; She said, for the first time
            since a very long time, she could feel her chest beat faster than normal. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll join the committee.&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">&mdash; </span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It took several years through that one unexpected event for her to realize that she
            liked teaching. She even started to feel that this was a hidden passion that her brain decided not to
            recognize. She almost felt like she wasted her time to think about her stresses, which led to dreads from
            her self-proclaimed boredom by isolation several nights before. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You are surprisingly very good with the kids!&quot; They said when they were
            also incredible and even better with children at several points. The small &quot;ah, not really, but thank
            you.&quot; That sentence was always murmured afterward by her. Sometimes, she could sense that her face
            became hot, and she felt bashful for a second. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;They are right, y&#39;know,&quot; her friend, who brought her to this
            situation, said. &quot;You&#39;re so good at teaching too. What did you prepare with the distribution
            team?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You said I was just going to distribute books and introduce them briefly to the
            kids. I did what I had to do, but they were asking for more information, so I gave it to them.&quot;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Mmm, did you enjoy it?&quot; Bingo. Right on the bull&#39;s eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">She stopped momentarily. Thinking about what she should say about it. There was no
            point in lying or acting. She could be honest. She could admit it went well with her boundaries. She could
            say that this truly relieves her desperation to be free and content.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But neither of that felt true enough at that time. She felt like it was too soon to
            say all those things when she just barely realised it at the moment. It was new for her, at least for her in
            this early adult livelihood. It needs to be studied and analysed before she could confidently confirm
            that&mdash;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Or it&#39;s just her form of anxiety. She mentally noted it to her brain,
            post-production of her boredom and tiredness.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Whatever it was, she gave her regular attitude instead in response with a petit
            refreshment that she rarely gave.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Probably almost as much as liking my idols,&quot; she smiled a little and
            continued before her friend could react, &quot;Socialising is not a bad thing, I guess when you start it
            with things you like. It went well with my boundaries.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a pause before her friend shouted happily, &quot;I knew it! It was almost
            according to you. But for me, you know, you ought to be more confident in yourself. You are good with
            people, just not knowing how to start and think that it is normal to not communicate with real people for a
            long time because your work is arresting you!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was a revelation for her. Her friend was partially, perhaps, fully right about
            it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Is it?&quot; She asked. The other smiled gently.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Look at the kids with the books you&#39;ve explained. They&#39;re happy that
            you socialized it for them, and they also get new knowledge.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">She placed her gaze on the kids that were gleefully exchanging conversations about
            the books that were just being distributed and explained by her. It was almost like watching a mirage, no?
            That expression was far too deviated. It felt like watching her idol&#39;s documentary, who was excited
            about new things outside their career&#39;s life that were being introduced by their fans and regular people
            around them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It made her feel enthusiastic, as if she could feel so many vibrant colors gushing
            through her soul and mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was terrifying. Thrilling. Exciting. If she had to confirm things, she would
            confirm those senses. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Say, honestly,&quot; her friend&#39;s voice brought her back to consciousness.
            She looked directly into her eyes while glancing at the afar scenery.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you happy?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">With that, she thought about the doomed cycle she&#39;s been into and thought that
            she probably could understand how to fix her suffering.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I am.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c7"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p>
