                            <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Arvish Jannali was thinking to himself in his room. He
                                    just finished celebrating
                                    his 15th birthday with his family. By only his 15th year of living, he has already
                                    begun to think of who he
                                    is. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">One day he even thought about why he was born in the first
                                    place.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have never agreed to anything, yet here I am
                                    existing,&rdquo; he
                                    exclaimed. He would spend the passing days asking that question to himself as there
                                    wasn&rsquo;t anyone that
                                    could provide an answer. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Arvish lived in a small lakeside house in the small town
                                    of Sale&#39;a&#39;fau,
                                    Republic of Vosso, with his mother, Matilda, and his elder sister, Talia. Arvish
                                    spent most of his life at
                                    home, where the only time he went out would be for school and errands.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c12">His father was a serving soldier for the Military of the
                                    Republic of Vosso. He
                                    was killed in battle even before his son could utter a word in 1898. Since his
                                    birth, Arvish lived under the
                                    coverage of his father&rsquo;s service family insurance under the Katinaian
                                    Protection Act until it was
                                    revoked right before the start of the Folclanian War.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At home, he would often ask about his father, curious about
                                    what kind of a man he
                                    became until his death.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mama, why did papa join the military?&rdquo; He asked
                                    one day. &ldquo;Was it
                                    his dream?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why did you ask the boy? Do you want to be like
                                    him?&rdquo; His mother
                                    replied.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, mama. I want to have a dream of my own
                                    too.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your papa was a strong and brave man. He joined the
                                    military to prove his
                                    loyalty to our nation.&rdquo; His mother said.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do I have to be strong and brave just like he
                                    was?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course! You are a man, soon to be a man of the
                                    house to add to that!&rdquo;
                                    His sister said.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t asking you.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your sister is right, Arvee. You are going to grow up
                                    to be a real man.&rdquo;
                                    His mother added.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">One night, like any other night, Arvish lay on his bed, his
                                    thoughts drifting deep in
                                    ponders. The only thing on his mind was what kind of a woman he would be when he
                                    grew up. </span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">All he knew was that he loved being himself, and all that he
                                    wanted to do was stay
                                    with his small family. But realistically, this was not possible, not until the war.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vosso was already on the brink of war, following the tension
                                    between Folclant and
                                    Marvirilleux since 1913 for the occupation of a strategic piece of land of
                                    Villers-Meceoux. All that led up
                                    to its boiling point when Folclant saw beyond diplomacy and launched an attack on
                                    Villers-Meceoux, cementing
                                    their occupation of the land in quick succession.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">All those altercations would sooner or later affect the land
                                    of the Republic of Vosso
                                    as one of the neighboring countries. Folclant did not seem to slow down their
                                    invasion effort anytime
                                    soon.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mama, are we going to war? Does that mean I have to
                                    join the military like
                                    papa?&rdquo; Arvish asked his mother.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, Arvee, we are safe. We have nothing to do with the
                                    war.&rdquo; His mom
                                    replied</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s good. I&rsquo;d hate to leave you to
                                    be a man, just like
                                    papa.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would really hate it to die fighting someone&rsquo;s
                                    war.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I told you, you won&rsquo;t, worry not, my boy,&rdquo;
                                    said His mother.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">What Matilda said wasn&#39;t optimistic but unrealistic. It
                                    was proven when
                                    Folclant&rsquo;s military had a violent altercation in Duena, the border between
                                    Vosso and Folclant. That
                                    event had marked the entry of Vosso into the war.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The situation had only gotten worse for the people in Vosso.
                                    Public activities were
                                    kept to a minimum. Everyone stayed at home, fearing that the massive course invasion
                                    would come anytime
                                    soon.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Schools were shut down, the roads were emptied, and military
                                    outposts were
                                    established all over the country. It was also bad for the Jannali family. The
                                    insurance was revoked
                                    following the situation, so the family had to work to bring food to the
                                    table.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Arvish, for the first time, felt the utmost feeling of burden
                                    for being the man of
                                    the family. All that he spent pondering had led him to this feeling. At the time of
                                    the war, he was already
                                    17. Next year, he would have to enlist under the mandatory regulation for all able
                                    men over 18.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Arvish knew for sure that, next year, he would be holding a
                                    rifle, firing at another
                                    man who was sent by another man to kill another man. Just the thought of it makes
                                    him so anxious. All that
                                    he wanted was to be by his family&rsquo;s side.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming. I won&rsquo;t be eating good food
                                    sometime next
                                    year,&rdquo; Arvish exclaimed.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This time will be behind us soon, Arvee. You will be
                                    fine. You are a strong
                                    man.&rdquo; His mom said to him,</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is unfair, Arv. I don&rsquo;t want to see you
                                    go,&rdquo; Talia said.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am a man, sis. It&rsquo;s my duty to protect the two
                                    of you.&rdquo;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will fight this war, and I&rsquo;ll come home for
                                    our dinner, just like this
                                    time.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will come home to us.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You better not die then.&rdquo; Talia jokes.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, you better stay alive in that old body of yours
                                    sister,&rdquo; answered
                                    Arvish.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">On June 3rd, 1917, Arvish officially enlisted in the
                                    Vossoan National Military. He
                                    would later be assigned to the 1st Infantry Battalion of the Vossoan Royal Regiment.
                                    And by May 4th, 1918,
                                    Arvish Jannali was sent for his first deployment on the Western Front to take
                                    Villers-Meceoux from the
                                    Folclant occupation.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Enlisted from Sale&rsquo;a&rsquo;fau, Arvish was assigned
                                    in a company alongside
                                    fellow Katinaians, the indigenous of the village. He was one of 850 Indigenous men
                                    who fought in the
                                    Folclanian War. He thought about whether their loyalty would be rewarded with better
                                    treatment.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">Private Arvish Jannali may have served his country and

                                    Front. He returned to FOB in Duena on January 27th, 1919. After recuperating in
                                    hospital for six months to
                                    recover from his battle wound, he was forced onto another mission. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4 c7"><span class="c0">There was no freedom for Jannali from the war where he
                                    went through hell, except
                                    for a few years when he was granted an exemption from the Katinaian Protection Act,
                                    but this was revoked. He
                                    never saw home, as he never returned to Sale&rsquo;a&rsquo;fau before he was sent
                                    back for another
                                    mission.</span></p>

                                    mission to Wiziburen,
                                    Marvirilleux. He was deployed alongside his squad under the Vossoan Expeditionary
                                    Force.</span></p>

                                    &ldquo;Wind&rdquo; Windella. Alongside
                                    Jannali are Corporal Yarre &ldquo;Kill&rdquo; Killiel and Private Caanan Bevan. They
                                    landed in Tichinde,

                                    their way from Tichinde to Wiziburen. Being in a no man&rsquo;s land, it was quite a
                                    long and dangerous
                                    drive, so they had to stay on their toes.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Enlighten me, sir. Why are we here again? I&rsquo;m

                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Those Folclanians are damn lunatics. We gave them

                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Easy, Kill. Folclant is here for the same reason as we

                                    there before they do to ensure the end of this war.&rdquo; The Sergeant
                                    explained.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, we&rsquo;re ending a battle with another battle,

                                    said.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, my children. I&rsquo;ll take all of

                                    alive in that aging body of yours.&rdquo; Private Caanan said.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have a few tricks up my sleeve, son, and it&rsquo;ll
                                    do.&rdquo; Replied the
                                    Sergeant.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">About 30km from their mission, they encountered an ambush by
                                    the Folclanian soldier
                                    who had already been there first. Jannali&rsquo;s squad was outnumbered and
                                    outgunned. The Folclant soldiers
                                    were firing from the tree lines.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jannali&rsquo;s squad had tried to return fire. They
                                    hadn&#39;t even burst the entire
                                    rounds from the magazine, but they were defeated in quick succession. Private Bevan
                                    and Corporal Yarre died
                                    first. It&rsquo;s the Sergeant, who, at his last moment, asked Jannali to
                                    run.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take the radio and get out of here, son.&rdquo;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m not leaving you, sir, not today,&rdquo;
                                    said Jannali as he
                                    attempted to drag his sergeant into safety.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let go of me, you stubborn bastard.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go, I&rsquo;ll hold them off,&rdquo; said The
                                    sergeant.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was an honor, sir,&rdquo; Jannali said to the
                                    sergeant.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">And just like that, Jannali was all by himself in enemy
                                    territory.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jannali was lucky enough to survive the attack, and he had to
                                    leave his dying
                                    sergeant behind to escape. Jannali managed to take the radio with him and ran deep
                                    into the opposing tree
                                    line to escape the search party.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">At that moment, Jannali realized that the mission was almost
                                    impossible to carry on.
                                    They were never told that the Folclant soldiers were already deep within the area,
                                    establishing their
                                    line.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">They were sent to certain death. As the only one who
                                    survived, Jannali had to find
                                    safety. Being all by himself, Jannali went onto the radio and asked his
                                    superintendent to call off the
                                    mission and requested extraction.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The answer was &lsquo;negative, get to Wiziburen and
                                    rendezvous with the second
                                    squad&rsquo;. Jannali had no other option but to get to Wiziburen all by
                                    himself.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The distance was approximately 25km, and there was no form of
                                    transport that could
                                    take him, so he decided to walk his way there. During his walk, Jannali would
                                    occasionally make stops to
                                    rest and attend to his wound from the last ambush that had killed his squad. </span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">All by himself, Jannali lay down and thought to himself, just
                                    like he would when he
                                    was home, in his small room.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They sent me to death. They sent me to my damned
                                    death.&rdquo; He
                                    exclaimed.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mother Vosso, I have been loyal to you.
                                    Why?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why did you send me here?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Along his way, Jannali would get on the radio to report what
                                    he had seen. He would
                                    occasionally ask his superintendent if he could finally call off the mission. The
                                    answer was the same,
                                    &lsquo;carry on and rendezvous with the second squad&rsquo;.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">His wound wasn&rsquo;t making things any better. The field
                                    medical kits would only
                                    make him last for so long. He might make it to Wiziburen, but he might not be able
                                    to make it back
                                    home.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Jannali walked and walked. He kept getting close to the
                                    treeline, one hand on his
                                    wound, another holding a pistol. He was walking down near Denth&rsquo;s Creek. He
                                    was feeling great pain in
                                    his wound.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">He sat down on a log and tended to his wound, but he had
                                    already known that it was
                                    impossible to save it. His legs were close to death. His eyes were wearing out.
                                    While he was resting, he
                                    transmitted his last report on the radio. It was the last thing heard from
                                    him.</span></p>
                            <p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The days went on, and the trace of Private Arvish Jannali was
                                    never found anymore.
                                    Not until a local farmer lady named Mrs. Steinh&auml;usl walked past a dead body and
                                    reported it.</span></p>

                                    Folclant had already declared diplomacy. The body Mrs. Steinh&auml;usl had found was
                                    sent to Vosso for
                                    identification and autopsy.</span></p>

                                    had been predetermined
                                    before my birth. I had no opportunity to see myself as I was shaped by this cruel
                                    life day by day. Looking
                                    back, I know that I&#39;ve done nothing. Yet here I am in this land of another man,
                                    dying with nothing but
                                    my name as my only friend. Avenge me, avenge me and stop this madness. Let us sit
                                    side by side and talk as
                                    friends. Let no son of another man be sent to his death, let no more mother lose her
                                    son, let no more dreams
                                    of a young man be buried within him, never to be realized. Let none of those things
                                    happen anymore, all for
                                    nothing but the ambition of a blind old man. </span></p>
