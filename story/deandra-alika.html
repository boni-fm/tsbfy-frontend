                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When did it started, she wonders. To be frank, she doesn&rsquo;t really remember
                                either. She doesn&rsquo;t remember how or when it started, or how she got here. The fragments of the
                                memories are probably laying carelessly on the floor and it feels somewhat draining to piece them back into
                                one. At least, she remembers how she came up to the door of her crib, accepting an envelope she was sure
                                sent from no one&mdash;not anybody she was reminded of, who still sends letter these days? Unless, it
                                wasn&rsquo;t a letter and she found out it was a wedding invitation. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It only adds up of why she ended up here now, sitting on the corner of a small,
                                humble caf&eacute; in the not-so-crowded part of the city but it sure was filled with a lot of things.
                                Funnily, it should&rsquo;ve been enough to shoo her away, but it didn&rsquo;t because she was there and the
                                scenes of the days counted until this very moment was moving in flashback like a film reel inside her head.
                                The small caf&eacute; sure hold its own charm and she was willing to let it kept her encaged in it until she
                                thought it was a bit too much of a nostalgia to stay over something so petty or quite irrelevant until a few
                                weeks earlier when she accepted the damned envelope. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The answer came right after she opened the broken-white envelope, it didn&rsquo;t
                                look so clean, being inside the bag of other letters and stuff. It didn&rsquo;t excite her one bit and the
                                name written on the invitation didn&rsquo;t make it better. She wondered if it was fever dream because if
                                she remembered things correctly, then it has been a few years since she saw the name. Probably, up until the
                                graduation of college and she decided to leave things behind. It feels like a long prolog into a very old
                                story that even herself hadn&rsquo;t touched, not sure why either, maybe it&rsquo;s because she
                                subconsciously dug a hole deep enough to bury the memories or she just decided that it wasn&rsquo;t worth
                                thinking about, or maybe it stayed in the back of her head sometimes but she was unwilling to accept it.
                            </span></p>
                        <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The things she decided not to pursue nor hold on any further. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like, a cheesy, teeny crush or the fear of failing the class, for example. In all
                                honesty, it was cheesy and it was the best she could ever summarize the situation. A sophomore year until
                                the she was preparing for her graduation, it was a clich&eacute; crush on your same circle friend and as
                                clich&eacute; as it could be, it was well hidden and still locked up tight in a chest somewhere between the
                                space of her memory and heart. Who wouldn&rsquo;t, honestly? He wasn&rsquo;t a bad man and was definitely
                                better compared to the rest, it wasn&rsquo;t her fault either that such weird persona could give her a sense
                                that the person was untouchable, at least by her. It was quite cute if she was able to tell the tales
                                without a bitter bite on her tongue, in reality she just couldn&rsquo;t and she just refused to open that
                                secret, not even to her old friends that still kept in touch with her even now. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was quite of a normal college anecdote and most likely, that was how she ended up
                                spending the rest of her college years. Hanging out with her friends, struggling with tests, and leaving out
                                at night after a long final exam week. It was normal and all. To think about it, she knew she was quite
                                close to him and as much as she protected the lines, she knew it might only be a huge fa&ccedil;ade she
                                created. After all, the consequences of having a crush on a friend from the same group most of the time
                                ended in doom. If it&rsquo;s not the relationship, then the friendship had to be buried six feet under, not
                                everybody was destined to have the romance genre movies ending. She knew that well and better than anybody,
                                probably it was just a smart excuse to hide the cowardice inside of her because if she ever got the chance
                                and guts to live to tell the story, she would, but she didn&rsquo;t and that was on her. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c8">That was how she ended up staring into blank space in a good five minutes in her car
                                before she could gather her courage to step out of the vehicle and enter the venue. Each of her footsteps
                                was filled and heavy with worry and unthinkable amount of questions. It was the same hesitancy because she
                                didn&rsquo;t know whether she should feel this weird or whether she should feel her chest tightening each
                                time she got closer to the big, broad door to the hall. It was years ago. An unfinished
                                matter&mdash;</span><span class="c3">but it was years ago</span><span class="c0">, she didn&rsquo;t have to
                                stumble on her own mind like that. If it wasn&rsquo;t for a loud greeting of her old friends, she probably
                                would&rsquo;ve dwell on the same cycle of thoughts for the rest of the wedding. She remembered her old
                                friend whispering to her about how she thinks they made such a good couple&mdash;the bridge and the groom.
                                She could only be relieved when her friend didn&rsquo;t catch that wistful smile she had for a very short
                                seconds on her face when they greeted her and joking on how the turntables of life for them to see another
                                one of their friend got married. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while!&rdquo;</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;they said.
                            </span><span class="c3">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been years.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;She replied with a
                                chuckle before the group started to gather and share what they have been up to. Some already found their
                                significant others and some has been around for quite a while, some changed a lot, both appearance-wise or
                                personality-wise. She noted on how a few years could really change a lot of things and the meeting was both
                                familiar and strange. A part of her could see the people that she used to hang with, one that wore glasses
                                and reminded them about the curfew, some others who looked quite free-spirited back in the days now seemed
                                to be more courteous about themselves. It changed but also didn&rsquo;t because they were practically the
                                same people, just went through a different narrative of adulting up until then, still do even when this
                                wedding party is over later. It was the exact same thing when she faced the groom in the party to
                                congratulate them. It felt forced, but was she happy to see him well, it felt like a false,
                                good-girl-selfless-faith, because the awkwardness was only on her and it lingered. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t her fault that she liked him nor was it her fault to stopped doing so
                                when she found out about his own crush at one, quiet night when their friends were getting their foods and
                                she was left to wait at the table with him. That was actually quite a night. The group decided they should
                                visit a beach before the semester was over and she agreed because it felt like a nice breeze in the middle
                                of her college year struggle. She probably could still talk about the sky being quite clear, they were all
                                talking while sitting on the sand, talking about whatever, it was fun. The sky was pretty, it was full
                                moon&mdash;not the best time to be near a beach, honestly, but it complimented the moment quite beautifully
                                because it was a piece of her youth. Early 20s and pursuing dreams, hand-in-hand in being realistic at the
                                same time. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">So standing here now, lending her hand out and faux-smiling at them, feeling
                                gruesomely bitter at her own head was truly a moment she&rsquo;d love to skip over. They greeted her first
                                and for some reason, the bride still remembered her and she remembered who she were. That was when she was
                                fully aware on how self-centered and selfish it sounded even in her own head to even feel bad about
                                something so holy like an occasion of tying the knot between the two people. Thus she shook his hand, gave
                                him some formalism congratulatory words before she left the hall. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyhow, it was strange, even when she drove away from that place and aimlessly
                                wandering around the town. Honestly should an old crush affect her this much? She wouldn&rsquo;t know
                                herself and she knew she couldn&rsquo;t get an answer from her friends, they never knew about it anyway. She
                                was good at hiding it and her friends were not world&rsquo;s most sensitive person, though it was okay for
                                her. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She drove past the familiar street where she used to hang with her college friends
                                back in the days. It looked both the same and different. She still see the same, old telephone box that they
                                didn&rsquo;t get rid of and she could still easily point out the corner of the street where they used to
                                place a bench on&mdash;the one that they did get rid of now. She saw a new caf&eacute; were opening too
                                along the street and she saw some newly built restaurants. Now the street felt more like a district than an
                                empty path, it was the charm to it but she didn&rsquo;t hate it either now. The new things filled the empty
                                space and she preferred that, it was easier for her heart. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now in a whole different part of the city where she sits, her eyes linger out of the
                                window and the fog of her coffee is no longer there from being left untouched. She remembers how the
                                friendship bloomed and what it takes for her to cut the line off for her own sake. The scene should&rsquo;ve
                                been familiar and she knows what happened well enough to not do the same thing again, it keeps rewinding
                                over and over inside her brain, God knows how long would it take for her to stop. It stopped for years until
                                now. The reason is clearly coming from her digging her own grave of memories, the ones she buried alive.
                            </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The time ticks tad a bit slower for now when she&rsquo;s staring into her drink and
                                the rain is pitter-patters outside of the caf&eacute;. She doesn&rsquo;t notice the sky even turned dark
                                until now. It&rsquo;s quite absurd for her to ponder over something like this and it&rsquo;s even weirder
                                that she lets herself doing so, feeding on her own gloom for the moment and refuses to move on because well,
                                everybody did. They moved on and are in a better places in their lives, not saying that she&rsquo;s not in a
                                great place but the attachment to old things sure can be one hell of a drag onto her ankles like shackles.
                            </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c8">In moments like these where she reconsiders her decisions, it&rsquo;s only humane to
                                see her usual nonchalant side starts to get very rowdy and making up long scenarios of </span><span
                                class="c3">what-ifs</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and what-not. Because there would be a ton of other choices
                                of how a story could unfold if she had chosen one different option that she didn&rsquo;t. Like how she
                                cusses her own fear and her tendency to look away from what she wants because she&rsquo;s scared of the
                                outcome, right before she even tried to dip a toe in. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like, what could be the worst scenario if that night she just blatantly told him how
                                cool he looked to her and how she admired him? What could be so bad in telling the person she liked
                                throughout her study before she graduated and had to change to adapt into a whole new environment? What
                                could&rsquo;ve gone so wrong if back then she could&rsquo;ve just told him everything because now, nothing
                                seemed to be that different from the outcomes she had calculated. They didn&rsquo;t keep in touch, they
                                didn&rsquo;t even meet each other until today. If she did what she should have, it would&rsquo;ve ended up
                                the same, probably just not attending the wedding and was it really worth the years of staying as quiet as
                                the mountain? </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As of now, probably she should just shakes it off of her mind. She huffs a small
                                smile along with a scoff at her own naivety and stupidity. It&rsquo;s an old crush, she notes to herself.
                                The time stops for the whole week to remind her of her unfinished business and she ought to learn how to
                                forget and pass on now. It&rsquo;s almost funny that she actually got this far just to give up on her own
                                bitterness that she never managed to properly touch until today. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And maybe those thoughts will linger only for today, just until the rain stops. When
                                it stops, the white cloth of her table would&rsquo;ve been clear of her traces and the time will tick again.
                                It will not stop, not anytime soon. Maybe by then learning and letting go would be a fact than a telltale
                                she held on. Then maybe her chapter will meet a prologue, then maybe the what-ifs wouldn&rsquo;t matter so
                                much anymore.</span></p>
