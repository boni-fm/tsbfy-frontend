            <p>
                This is the story of a boy who chased the sunset until it chased him</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">One day, there&rsquo;s a boy named Pierre, he lives in a little town on the
                        southside of Christchurch, New Zealand. He never quite sure about his placement in this world,
                        he&rsquo;s confused, lost, broken, invisible.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He&rsquo;s not even sure about himself or where he&rsquo;s been in this blue
                        world.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">One day, Pierre met a girl, his name is Abigaelle, he thought she has the
                        prettiest name that he ever heard. Abigaelle is a pretty girl who lives on the Christchurch&rsquo;s
                        northern outskirts.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pierre enjoys chasing sunsets, so he travels around town from the southern to the
                        northern parts of Christchurch, and from the eastern to the western parts of Christchurch, all to see
                        the beautiful sunsets that are usually seen in the northern part of Christchurch.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He went there frequently just to see the most beautiful sunset and Abigaelle.
                        Abigaelle, on the other hand, is a girl who enjoys chasing sunsets, but since the most beautiful sunset
                        is located near where she lives, she doesn&#39;t have to chase it as much as Pierre does.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every day, Abigaelle sits on her balcony to watch the sunset; she lives in a
                        cottage near the beach, where Pierre also goes to watch the sunset.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She then went to the beach to observe the sunset. She just realized that watching
                        it from the beach looks much better because it appears to be closer. Pierre then approached Abigaelle as
                        she sat on the sand watching the sunset. Abigaelle initially ignores him, but eventually Pierre melts
                        her with his poetic words, and she realizes that this man can speak in poems.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They began to talk about nature and the town&#39;s beautiful environment,
                        exchanging ideas and perspectives on people from the south and north.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In this case, people from the southside usually don&#39;t like the way people
                        from the northside live; they&#39;re usually jealous because people from the northside usually live
                        individually and most of them live in a glamorous and comfortable way.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In contrast, the people of the South are used to struggling to find their own
                        happiness, and the majority of them live in the most complex way possible.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abigaelle admires Pierre&#39;s way of thinking and his perspective on northern
                        people, as he stated, &quot;Northern people are the people who have been struggling and working hard in
                        order to achieve their dreams, and I look up to them so much.&quot;</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Time flies, the two have been meeting frequently to watch sunsets and talk,
                        Pierrre then fell in love with Abigaelle, &quot;She&#39;s extremely adorable,&quot; he said the first
                        time he saw her.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abigaelle knows a lot about Pierre and what he did in the past, she knows his
                        complicated life and tragic past.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pierre was a boy who&rsquo;s been through a lot of ups and downs but never
                        managed to help himself to get out of it. He thought Abigaelle could help himself to heal.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They get along, but it&rsquo;s only for a while.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Months after they get along, Pierre seems to get better and better with his
                        life.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It feels like I can&rsquo;t live without you, Abi&rdquo; he said that to
                        Abigaelle.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember everything, how I lived before you came into my
                        life&rdquo; says Pierre.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pierre knew that he had loved and had been loved, but he had no chronological
                        order to place it.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had no idea how to confess his feelings to Abi, afraid that she might not want
                        him to be with her.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Time flies, and Abigaelle never forgets what Pierre&#39;s life was like in the
                        past; she&#39;s afraid of becoming attached to him one day. So, she decided to abandon him because she
                        believes their relationship will never work. </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So confusing&rdquo; Pierre said</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He awoke without Abigaelle by his side, and all he knew was that he woke up every
                        day with amnesia and the case of new memories that he had a tendency to mistake for his fantasy, he
                        thought Abigaelle was a myth he made up for himself, and his mental state gotten worse. So, he went to
                        the mountain every day to recover his past in order to understand his future. </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember all this&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pierre was a mischief with vision, but his best trait was his wisdom, which
                        Abigaelle eventually kills. Pierre&#39;s mind was as vibrant and blue as the city in which he lived.
                    </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where you goin&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why did you leave?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He keeps telling himself that.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abigaelle had no idea about his struggles in these harsh lands, but he gave her
                        the upper hand in his emotional tantrums.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once again, he&rsquo;s lost, broken, invisible.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Brace yourself&rdquo; </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never let you go&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abi once said this to Pierre but,</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a liar and it confuses me&rdquo; she lies to him said that
                        she&rsquo;d never let him go, passion, pain and desire runs through his veins. </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">So much so, that he redefines inevitable, so it&#39;ll never go, it seems as
                        though the sun wouldn&#39;t set at all instead of setting slow, and as the time goes, Pierre lived
                        forever on and never and forever alone</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pierre wrote a song about Abigaelle, which he sang one day while watching the
                        sunset. </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m running around thinking about you, </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heads in the cloud and I highly doubt that you care anymore,</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">You said that we&rsquo;re over, I&#39;m just making sure.</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s always been you&hellip;</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s always been you&hellip;</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s always been you&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A voice speaks from Pierre&#39;s head, saying, &quot;We should never end this, I
                        love you...&quot;</span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He said &ldquo;Does she love me, I&rsquo;ll never know, our love virtues, forever
                        on til she kills my soul, you&#39;re all that I&#39;ll know Abi&rdquo; </span></p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">a beautiful confusion, I&#39;m Pierre.</span></p>
                <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                <p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>
