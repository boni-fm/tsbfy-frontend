                                    stumble around and nearly
                                    fall down. They slam the door behind them, Shane puts out his arm and excitedly
                                    yell</span></p>
                            <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>

                                    arrive at Shane&rsquo;s
                                    bedroom they throw things around to make space for their stuff. After that Raily
                                    gestures to the bed and
                                    they are arguing to which sides the want to be and finally they are agreeing on
                                    their sides. Raily tease
                                    Shane about his height and hyperbolically says that Shane is sixteen feet, which
                                    makes Shane giggles and
                                    says &ldquo;Okay that&rsquo;s true&rdquo;</span></p>

                                    place is big enough to fit their belonging so they didn&rsquo;t have to fight yet.

                                    listening to her laughs behind her. Shane and Raily agrees that they will fight
                                    sooner or later because they
                                    are trapped in the same space and will spent a lot of time together.</span></p>

                                    Raily is filming Shane cooking. Raily opens her mouth to say that she knows Shane
                                    can cook but usually when
                                    they go out they just get take-out and this is the first time Shane cook for her.
                                    Shane turns to the camera
                                    and starts gesturing with wooden spoon he is holding and says &ldquo; well, this

                                    responding by arguing that Shane have as much Chipotle as she does making Shane
                                    laughs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
