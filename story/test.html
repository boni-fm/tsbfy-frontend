        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">1209619038/19SB</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Romance</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c8">Catch You on The Outskirts</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Life in the city has always been such an exciting event for Louis. Growing up in
                        the rural area of the country, there wasn&#39;t much the place could offer him. Everywhere he
                        looked, he was met with the vast empty space of the hills. If he was lucky enough, he&rsquo;d
                        catch a glimpse of other&rsquo;s cows and sheep munching on the grass, of little kids playing
                        tag before disappearing from his sight.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c5">Louis was six years old the first time he heard of life outside of his village.
                        Mr. Collins, the owner of the biggest farm in the village, just came back from some business in
                        the city. He had been gone for longer than three months&mdash;longer than anyone had ever
                        been&mdash;and everyone was so excited to hear whatever stories he brought back from the city.
                        It was one strange concept that little Louis couldn&rsquo;t help but be weirded out by the
                        thought of it. He couldn&rsquo;t imagine not living in his amazing and exciting village.
                </span><span class="c5 c7">I get to feed the cows, wash them, milk them, and shear wools from the sheep.
                        Why would I need to travel outside? </span><span class="c1">he thought.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But as years went by and more and more people visited the city, his curiosity was
                        piqued. One time, when he was no older than ten, his uncle offered to take him there. He was
                        extremely reluctant; he didn&rsquo;t want to leave his mother alone to tend the livestock. But
                        his mother insisted that she would be fine with the help from the neighbors. So, with
                        heavy-heart, he took off with his uncle. What Louis didn&rsquo;t expect was how life-changing
                        that one trip would be for him.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tall houses surrounded him from every way. &ldquo;How come the houses are taller
                        than the trees? I can&rsquo;t even stack my bricks to match the height of the trees in the
                        backyard!&rdquo; said Louis. &ldquo;And why does every house shine so brightly?&rdquo;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t that make this place so much more interesting?&rdquo;
                        Laughed his uncle. Louis really thought he was going to be blind that day.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Since then, he dreamed of packing and leaving in search of a more exhilarating
                        life. After saving up for years from helping on his family farm, he finally felt ready to
                        leave.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Promise me you&rsquo;ll visit your old mother here?&rdquo; His mother
                        joked to him.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mother, please. You&rsquo;re the youngest mother with an adult kid here,
                        you&rsquo;re not old at all.&rdquo; Louis reciprocated with a chuckle.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I know, I know.&rdquo; Jolene pulled him into her embrace, &ldquo;Now go,
                        Mr. Collins&rsquo; already outside. It&rsquo;s not kind to let other people wait on
                        us.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; Louis said while being ushered outside,
                        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you soon, yeah? Take care. Love you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You too, hun.&rdquo; Jolene kissed his forehead before letting go.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis hopped onto Mr. Collins&rsquo; ride. He could hear chatter from where his
                        mother was standing, but Mr. Collins already took off.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis has been living in the city for more than half a decade now and he&rsquo;s
                        been back home for a total of zero time. It&rsquo;s not like he doesn&rsquo;t want to, but life
                        in the city is hard. The first year he was here, he planned to visit his mother, but he was
                        working at such a strict job. He couldn&rsquo;t leave or risk messing up all the work he and his
                        co-workers had done. The next few years, after he landed a new job, he couldn&rsquo;t go back
                        home because new and old clients kept on coming to see him.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">To work using his brain turns out to be far more draining than any other physical
                        work he has ever done in his entire life, and now that he thinks about it, maybe that first job
                        was not strict at all and he just so happened to have an awful boss.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis was determined, though. He had decided that this year, no matter what, he
                        had to be visiting his hometown and showering his mother with his love and embrace.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s how he finds himself driving his car down a similar road, one
                        he&rsquo;s taken numerous times in his youth. His car comes to a halt right before entering the
                        village. He takes in the sight; the same place where memories of his childhood were made. Not
                        much has changed since he left, he noticed; other than that, a new and shiny big building in the
                        middle. Whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or not he doesn&rsquo;t know.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis was about to continue his drive when a thump coming from the direction of a
                        tree a few feet from his car caught his attention. He watched a girl, not much younger than him,
                        dusting off her pants in confusion. &ldquo;Uh, where did you&hellip;&rdquo; he trailed
                        off.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh, I was just up there on the tree.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis can&rsquo;t help but be surprised by her casualty in answering that. Living
                        in the city for so long has made him forget how leisure life is here. &ldquo;So, are you from
                        here or are you just visiting?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The girl in question looks at him in silence for a second, blinking before
                        responding, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t remember me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sorry, should I?&rdquo; Louis grimaced.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ellie, El for short.&rdquo; She offers her hand for Louis to
                        shake. &ldquo;Does that ring a bell?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis seems to be thinking about it, recalling every childhood friend of his and
                        trying to match their faces with the pretty girl standing in front of him now.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You hitched a ride with my father when you left for the city,
                        Louis.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis can feel his eyes widen on its own at that. &ldquo;No way! You&rsquo;re Mr.
                        Collins&rsquo; youngest?!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; Ellie confirmed, popping the p at the end. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
                        the snot, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, &lsquo;t was all over you then,&rdquo; he chuckles, &ldquo;But
                        seriously, you&rsquo;ve changed so much since the last time I saw you. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
                        recognized you otherwise.&rdquo; Louis thinks he sees Ellie lowering her head at his response,
                        but he isn&rsquo;t one hundred percent sure of it. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So, would you like to hitch a ride back home with me?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh my, Louis!&rdquo; Jolene exclaimed at the entrance of their home,
                        pulling Louis into her warm and tight embrace, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you so much! How have
                        you been, love?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good, been missing home so much, though, these days. I&rsquo;m sorry I
                        didn&rsquo;t visit sooner.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, love. I know you&rsquo;ve got tons of things to do
                        there.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, but that does not justify me not visiting you for five freaking
                        years, Mother.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jolene pulled back, cupping his cheeks in her hands, &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re
                        here now. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s more important, alright? How long are you gonna
                        stay?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Not for long, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid. About two weeks at most.&rdquo;
                </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jolene looks at his apologetic face before smiling, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than
                        enough time for me to pamper you like old times.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis would be lying if he says he isn&rsquo;t having the time of his life right
                        now. He&rsquo;s missed having someone who cares enough to clean after himself. He thinks maybe
                        if he could, he would love to move back permanently and abandon his life and responsibility in
                        the city. But life does not work that way, and Louis finds himself inside his car ready to head
                        back to the city.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Try to visit more often in the future, yeah?&rdquo; his mother reminds
                        him. &ldquo;It does get lonely sometimes even with the mothers making themselves at
                        home.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis nods and leans out the car window to hug his mother once more before he
                        drives away. He stops the car at the entrance of the village to take in the sight for one last
                        time when a thud surprises him again. He sees Ellie kneeling on the ground, wincing her face as
                        she tries to stand up.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;El, are you okay?&rdquo; he rushes to her side, helping her to her feet.
                        &ldquo;You really need to stop scaring people like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m fine. Thanks, Lou.&rdquo; She smiles at him. &ldquo;Are
                        you leaving already?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis nods, sighing at the reminder of his departure. &ldquo;I preferred to stay
                        longer if I could but alas.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Ellie murmurs under her breath.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">His head snaps so fast at that, &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Bye, Louis. I&rsquo;ll see you when you get back next time.&rdquo; With
                        that, Ellie leaves him there, frozen where he stands staring at the back of her head. Perhaps he
                        heard that wrong.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis is getting better at
                        visiting his hometown for the next couple of years. He never went more than six months without
                        going at least once, and in every trip, Ellie never missed a chance to greet him at the same
                        spot every time. They developed a rather unique friendship from the events. Or so Louis
                        thinks.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jolene didn&rsquo;t think much about it at first, but with each time Louis came
                        back with Ellie occupying his passenger seat, she grew more and more suspicious of him. She used
                        to always give him side-glances and raised eyebrows. They are having dinner when she decides to
                        confront him about it. &quot;So, what&#39;s going on with you and Ellie? You&#39;ve been coming
                        back with her for how many times now?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Nothing&#39;s going on with El, Mother.&quot; Louis swallows the food in
                        his mouth. &quot;I just happen to meet her on the outskirts every time. Why? Is there anything
                        wrong?&quot; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jolene blinks at him before her face contorts with disbelief. &quot;You are way
                        too oblivious for your own good.&quot; She shakes her head.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;She&#39;s waiting for you, Louis.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And so, when the time for Louis to head back to the city comes, he is determined
                        to find out whether his mother is right about it. He leaves early in the morning in hope to
                        reach his destination first. How right he was when he checks the tree and finds no feet dangling
                        from above. He waits for a few hours before Ellie shows up at their rendezvous.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m guessing Jolene slapped some sense into you,&rdquo; she says as
                        a matter of fact, holding back a smile.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis shakes his head yes and they both fall silent. &ldquo;I&mdash;I have to get
                        back now. Got an early appointment tomorrow. Have to prepare and everything,&rdquo; Louis
                        states, breaking the quiet atmosphere surrounding them.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c5">&ldquo;</span><span class="c5 c7">Oh</span><span class="c1">. Yeah, of
                        course,&rdquo; Ellie says before adding, &ldquo;Drive safely, Louis.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Louis can&rsquo;t help but notice the slight change in her tone. He decides there
                        and then that he doesn&rsquo;t like hearing it coming from her. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll see you
                        when I come again, yeah? Here, on the outskirts of this village?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A grin slowly appears on Ellie&rsquo;s face, and yeah, Louis likes that much
                        better.</span></p>
