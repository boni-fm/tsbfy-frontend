                                    getting up from a dining
                                    chair. It&#39;s a dinner night at the house of two Jade siblings. &nbsp;However,
                                    Oliver&mdash;the elder one,
                                    seems not interested in finishing his meal.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? You&#39;ve been skipping
                                    your meal lately.&quot;
                                    Asks Ivie, the younger sister who recognizes Oliver&#39;s weird expression which he
                                    terribly attempts to
                                    hide so it still can be spotted by her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Nothing, I just have loads of work to do. You can have
                                    my dinner.&quot; Replies
                                    Oliver who started to walk away, approaching his room.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;No!! I&#39;ll put it away and you can warm it if you
                                    want!&quot; Says Ivie
                                    whose voice is raised so Oliver who walks away can listen to her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oliver is in his room now, he tries to continue his
                                    work&mdash;finishing a proposal
                                    that will be very important for his business. Actually, he doesn&#39;t need to
                                    finish it soon because he
                                    still has plenty of time before the business meeting starts next month. However,
                                    it&#39;s his mind that is
                                    busier lately, since he&#39;s contemplating something more interesting to him. He is
                                    recalling a young girl
                                    that used to be his dearest person back in his teenage days, Magnolia.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magnolia was his only friend in school. They shared some
                                    similarities where they
                                    didn&#39;t have many friends, so they only had each other. Both of them also liked
                                    to read fantasy and
                                    adventure stories. Yet the difference was that Magnolia tended to love telling
                                    everything interesting to
                                    her&mdash;whether it was her own experience or about the story that had just been
                                    read by her. Oliver
                                    didn&#39;t like to tell stories, but he really loved when Magnolia told him a story.
                                    At that time, he would
                                    watch any expression of her which would change in each story, while the most
                                    unforgettable thing about her
                                    is her golden amber eyes which were really bright and alive.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oliver remembered the time when Magnolia suddenly gave him a
                                    rose quartz necklace and
                                    said, &quot;Do you love someone? If you love someone you can give her
                                    this.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oliver did not understand at that time, but he pleasantly
                                    accepted and kept it in his
                                    pencil case, until someday, he realized that he loved Magnolia. Yet, what could he
                                    do? He was not that brave
                                    to express his feelings, he worried that it would destroy their friendship, or it
                                    could even make him lose
                                    her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He then remembered a rose quartz necklace, a gift from
                                    Magnolia, and also her words
                                    when she gave it. So he thought that it would be the best way to express his
                                    feelings. But, alas, he
                                    didn&#39;t find it. There was no rose quartz necklace in his pencil case. The loss
                                    of that thing led him to
                                    feel guilty thus he never told Magnolia about it as well as his feelings.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The day of school graduation came. After the ceremony,
                                    Magnolia met Oliver in the
                                    school garden and they congratulated each other. It was the time when Magnolia told
                                    that her family would
                                    move to a faraway country and live in a solitary and lovely village there. For the
                                    first time, Oliver
                                    didn&#39;t like to listen to her story since she said that she would follow her
                                    family and continue her
                                    study in that country&mdash;which means they would be separated miles away.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;Why have you told me now, Meg?&quot; Asked Oliver,
                                    whose eyebrows were
                                    frowned.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Replied her.
                                    &quot;Actually&hellip; I just hope that you
                                    will give me back the necklace.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her words were really hard for Oliver to process, so he asked
                                    again, &quot;Give you
                                    back the necklace?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Magnolia nodded. &quot;Yeah, I like you and I hope you like
                                    me. I gave you the
                                    necklace and I hope you will give it back to me. So&hellip; Maybe I have a reason to
                                    not go with my family.
                                    But, no, it was a dumb idea. I have to be with them.&quot; She said it frankly with
                                    her golden eyes, which
                                    were really bright, focused on Oliver&#39;s. Yet, Oliver could also sense a kind of
                                    sorrowful sight from it.
                                    Her sight and words made Oliver&#39;s heart beat so fast, but he only could stare
                                    back at Magnolia&#39;s
                                    eyes.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, it was hard for words to get out of Oliver&#39;s
                                    mouth, so he abruptly
                                    hugged her tightly. When he finally got a nerve, he confessed that he liked her too
                                    but the rose quartz
                                    necklace was gone, so he felt guilty and couldn&#39;t find a way to confess his
                                    feelings. Between the hug,
                                    they were crying for a moment. Then, Magnolia said, &quot;Thanks, Oliver. Please
                                    don&#39;t feel guilty,
                                    it&#39;s just a necklace.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Their conversation at that time ended after they promised to
                                    write a letter to each
                                    other every week. Oliver also promised that he would come to Magnolia at the right
                                    time someday and fetch
                                    her up to live together. They agreed then parted away.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The time changes, in Oliver&#39;s thirty-fifth, when he&#39;s
                                    contemplating his past
                                    with Magnolia. His jaw is clenched. It is all lovely to remember her, but it is also
                                    shameful because they
                                    stopped writing letters to each other ten years ago, and he also can&#39;t fulfill
                                    his promise to come to
                                    her. He takes a really deep breath and breathes it out roughly. The worst thing, he
                                    feels guilty since he
                                    remembers the fact that it was him and his ego that caused all of these problems.
                                    However, he thinks that he
                                    still can fix all of these and come to Magnolia. This idea comes again to him years
                                    ago, when he realized
                                    that he still misses and loves her truly, when he admitted how stupid he was.
                                    Lately, this idea is getting
                                    louder and bigger in his mind. Besides, he also thinks that now is the right time to
                                    fulfill his promise to
                                    her. Therefore, in the middle of the night, with all the necessary things that are
                                    packed in his old brown
                                    suitcase and with his black suit that looks well on his skinnier body, he slowly
                                    walks out of his room.
                                    Before he departs, he walks to the dining room when he realizes that he needs to eat
                                    something. After eating
                                    two slices of bread, he doesn&#39;t forget to pack some of it as well as some water.
                                    Then, he leaves a
                                    little note to inform Ivie that he will go to manage an urgent business for weeks
                                    and will be back very
                                    soon.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Seven hours later, Oliver is on a ship that is heading
                                    straight to a country where he
                                    wants to go. He is standing on the deck of the ship while staring at the vast blue
                                    sea. His mind flies again
                                    to the past when he had a letter every week from Magnolia and when he wrote back to
                                    her. It was his youth
                                    story which was full of happiness, where he could keep in touch with Magnolia who
                                    lived miles away, where he
                                    couldn&#39;t listen to her stories but still could read those every week through the
                                    letter, where he learnt
                                    that Magnolia continued her study at the college in a city that was pretty far from
                                    her family in a village.
                                    Yet those kinds of happiness were over when Olliver was twenty-second, the lowest
                                    time of him when he failed
                                    on his way to achieve his dream and when he lost his beloved parents. Hence his
                                    foolishness took over his
                                    mind. At this time, he felt he did not deserve Magnolia&#39;s love, so without
                                    telling her his condition or
                                    any obvious reason, he asked her to stop writing a letter to him and find another
                                    better person. However,
                                    Magnolia still sent him a letter every week, yet Oliver never wanted to read it
                                    since she was afraid to fall
                                    in love with her deeper. He let the letters from her pile up in his room while
                                    denying that he still loved
                                    her. It happened for three years until there was no letter from her again. Oliver
                                    himself admitted that it
                                    was his worst decision, he should&rsquo;ve not done that, he obviously regrets it,
                                    hoping there is a time
                                    machine that can bring him back to the time where he still keeps in touch with the
                                    dearest Magnolia. </span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Instead of contemplating his past, he decided to go to
                                    Magnolia and fix the problem
                                    he made. This idea brings Oliver here, on the deck of the ship, who is determined to
                                    find his old love. In
                                    fact, he doesn&#39;t know exactly where Magnolia lives, but he just relies on the
                                    address of the last letter
                                    from her, which was sent ten years ago and has never been read by him. He
                                    doesn&#39;t know why, he is still
                                    afraid and somehow not ready to read each word in that letter.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Nearly a week later, in the early morning, the ship reaches
                                    its destination&mdash;the
                                    harbor of the faraway country. He thinks that he should give Magnolia something when
                                    they meet, so he buys a
                                    pretty huge bouquet for her. After that, Oliver looks for another transportation
                                    that could bring him to a
                                    village named Canopus. After eight hours on the train and then on the cart, he
                                    arrives. This village suits
                                    Magnolia&#39;s description years ago, a solitary and beautiful place filled with
                                    greenery. No wonder
                                    Magnolia and her family really love this place, even though it is pretty far from
                                    the city. There are not
                                    many houses in this village, so it makes Oliver&rsquo;s spirit increase. It will
                                    make Magnolia&rsquo;s house
                                    easily spotted, won&#39;t it?</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, the fact isn&rsquo;t as easy as Oliver&rsquo;s
                                    expectations. Here, some
                                    houses have no master. Other than that, the villagers who are in their houses
                                    don&rsquo;t know who Magnolia
                                    Jasper is when Oliver asks them, as if the Jasper family has never lived in this
                                    place. The sun is getting
                                    sunken to the west, along with Oliver who is getting tired because he realizes that
                                    he hasn&#39;t eaten
                                    anything since he gets off from the ship. He then visits the only inn in that
                                    village that also has a bistro
                                    in it. There he orders a bottle of water and some gingerbread. He puts the bouquet
                                    hat he brings on the
                                    table. He feels really tired, if he can&#39;t meet Magnolia, he can&#39;t give her
                                    the flowers.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare for a traveler or even a villager to
                                    visit my little place.
                                    But those who come here always look umm&hellip; pathetic.&rdquo; Says a woman, who
                                    owns the inn,
                                    abruptly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">It makes Oliver&rsquo;s sight turn to her, he then says,
                                    &ldquo;I&#39;m looking for a
                                    person who lives in this village, but no one knows her.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The owner of this inn who looks busy preparing freshly baked
                                    gingerbread on the plate
                                    says, &ldquo;You have to know that most villagers could not live here for a long
                                    time, maybe only for four
                                    or five years. This village is really beautiful but it is far away from the market
                                    center and hospital.
                                    Those who prefer a busy place or any place that is closer to the city will move
                                    out.&quot; She continues,
                                    &quot;But for me, I prefer a place like this, a beautiful place where I can grow my
                                    food all by myself and
                                    run a farm as well as a small inn for both travelers and villagers.&rdquo;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oliver listens to her. He somehow sees a resemblance of
                                    Magnolia&#39;s personality in
                                    that woman since he thinks that Magnolia will say the same thing as her. Hence, he
                                    says, &ldquo;But I think
                                    she&#39;s the person who really loves this place and has lived here for more than
                                    six years.&rdquo;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The owner immediately turns to Oliver, putting a plate of
                                    gingerbread and a bottle of
                                    water on his table. &ldquo;Who are you looking for?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Magnolia Jasper.&rdquo; replies Oliver frankly,
                                    &ldquo;I want to meet
                                    her.&rdquo;. Then, the woman&rsquo;s eyebrows frown, but her eyes make an expression
                                    that can&rsquo;t be
                                    interpreted by him. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you Oliver Jade?&rdquo; the woman guesses. Oliver
                                    is startled because the
                                    woman in front of him knows his name, even his full name.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So he asks, &nbsp;&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I was Magnolia&rsquo;s good friend here. We have lived
                                    in this village
                                    together for a little long time. She always told me about you,&quot; The woman
                                    replies. &quot;Ten years ago,
                                    when the ship that took her and her family to another place sank, the help came late
                                    to save them. They died
                                    and fortunately their bodies could be identified.&rdquo; Continues the woman with
                                    sorrowful eyes.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The fact that is previously conveyed to Oliver is immediately
                                    stabbing his heart and
                                    scratching his mind. &ldquo;Magnolia and her family died when they moved out?
                                    You&rsquo;re lying,
                                    right?&rdquo; Asks Oliver, but the woman has no words to reply and just shakes her
                                    head.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, Oliver asks again, &ldquo;How did it happen? Could you
                                    tell me?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Have
                                    you read her last
                                    letter?&rdquo; Asks the woman. Then Oliver shakes his head, feeling completely
                                    guilty and regretful since he
                                    never read Magnolia&#39;s letter, even the last one. &ldquo;I want you to read it,
                                    and you can visit her
                                    grave in this village&rsquo;s cemetery. It was in the west of this village, near the
                                    sunflowers
                                    field.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">There are no words except &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; from
                                    Oliver&rsquo;s mouth. He puts
                                    some money on his table, grabs the bouquet, and runs away from the inn, leaving his
                                    gingerbreads and
                                    water.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Several minutes later, he arrives at the cemetery. His breath
                                    is out of control while
                                    his eyes scan here and there to spot the grave that has the name Magnolia Jasper
                                    curved on it. Then he stops
                                    when he spots a grave of someone who has the name of Magnolia, along with the exact
                                    same date of birth. Yet,
                                    he senses a strange thing. Her surname is different, it changes into Magnolia Agate.
                                    Oliver is beyond
                                    perplexed, did he find the wrong grave? But the date of birth that is carved on the
                                    grave is exactly right.
                                    He also spots the other two graves on the left side which have the names of
                                    Magnolia&rsquo;s parents, the
                                    Jasper family. Hence, Oliver is really sure that it is Magnolia&rsquo;s, but why is
                                    it only her that has a
                                    different surname?</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He is still confused until he realizes that there is another
                                    grave, on the right side
                                    of Magnolia&rsquo;s, the grave of Oleander Agate. The four of them have the same
                                    date of death. Then Oliver
                                    just recognizes their death had happened approximately a week after Magnolia sent
                                    him the last letter.
                                    Startled, he dropped the bouquet of flowers on his hand to reach for the letter in
                                    his suit pocket. Hoping
                                    that he would be enlightened about what exactly happened to them, and especially
                                    about the Agates surname,
                                    he then opens it and starts to read every word on it.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">While reading the letter, he learns that Magnolia worked as a
                                    teacher at the
                                    neighboring village after she finished her study. He learns that Magnolia
                                    emotionally suffered so much for
                                    three years since Oliver stopped writing for her. He learns that Magnolia needed him
                                    and really loved him
                                    until she met another person. It was all like what Oliver asked, Magnolia could meet
                                    another person,
                                    Oleander Agate&mdash;who was better for her and always be there for her until they
                                    married ten years ago.
                                    Then Oliver continues to read:</span></p>

                                    nice and he knows
                                    everything about you. He&#39;s even with me now, accompanying me to write this for
                                    you</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c5">Next week, two weeks after our marriage, I, Oleander, and
                                    also my parents will move
                                    to another country. We need to go there by ship. I hate to say this, but I think a
                                    letter from me every week
                                    will disturb you so much. I decide that I&#39;ll write to you another day&mdash;at
                                    the right and lovely time
                                    when we&rsquo;re already moved in. So, I&#39;m truly sorry to break our promise,
                                    Oliver.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c5">I hope you read this letter, but importantly I hope you can
                                    always discover a million
                                    of happiness in your life, even when you&rsquo;re in your lowest time. I don&#39;t
                                    know whether you have met
                                    your source of happiness or haven&#39;t. But, I&#39;ll always pray for you that
                                    hopefully, you&rsquo;ll meet
                                    or always be with someone that you love and loves you dearly, someone that will make
                                    your world brighter.
                                    Hope you, your parents, and the sweet Ivie are always happy and in full
                                    health.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c5">I&#39;ll always love you, my best friend, my dearest
                                    soulmate.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;Love
                                    always, Magnolia</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The tear flows down Oliver&#39;s cheeks. He drops to his
                                    knees when he feels his legs
                                    sore. His feelings in his heart can&#39;t easily be described by him since regret,
                                    sadness, relief, and love
                                    are all mingled into one. He feels grief and sorry because he let a precious person
                                    walk away from his life.
                                    He foolishly lost Magnolia and now he must accept the fact that he can&#39;t see her
                                    anymore and he
                                    can&#39;t listen to nor even read her stories anymore. He also felt sorry, since he
                                    never told Magnolia
                                    about his parents&rsquo; death. Causing her, in her last letter, to kindly hope for
                                    happiness and health for
                                    Oliver&#39;s parents without knowing that they already died. But on the other hand,
                                    there is another feeling
                                    of relief when he knows that Magnolia never hated him and could meet her beloved
                                    one, her happiness. That
                                    evening, Oliver&#39;s feelings are too overwhelming, until he is fast asleep, right
                                    near Magnolia&#39;s
                                    tomb.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, in the dark of the night, Oliver feels that
                                    someone&#39;s hand is shaking his
                                    shoulder slowly. He opens his eyes and sees a bearded old man. &quot;Are you okay,
                                    Sir?&quot; Asks the old
                                    man. Oliver, who starts to be aware of his surroundings, immediately gets up from
                                    his position, &quot;Oh,
                                    I&#39;m alright, Sir.&quot; </span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The old man offers Oliver help, but he refuses it politely,
                                    thanks to him for his
                                    offer, and says he will go in a moment. When the old man goes away, Oliver turns to
                                    Magnolia&#39;s grave in
                                    front of him. Then his eyes move to Oleander&#39;s and Magnolia&#39;s parents&#39;
                                    graves until his eyes
                                    turn again to Magnolia&#39;s. He hardly breathes, then he touches Magnolia&#39;s
                                    grave, stroking it slowly.
                                    He then says, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Meg. I came too late. And&hellip; I don&#39;t
                                    know if I can find another
                                    source of happiness or not. But I&#39;m looking forward to it.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">He feels the harsh and cold texture of the stone grave, and
                                    he says again, &quot;I
                                    love you and I&#39;ll always miss you for my whole life. Thank you very much for
                                    everything.&quot;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After that, he stares at Magnolia&#39;s grave for a while.
                                    Now, the tears can&#39;t
                                    seem to come out of his eyes. So, he smiles and acknowledges the weird feelings that
                                    revolve around his
                                    heart, while hoping that Magnolia will see his smile from up there. He then realizes
                                    that he dropped the
                                    bouquet near his legs, so he picks it up. Even though the flowers are slightly
                                    shriveled, it still looks
                                    alright and their fragrance still can be smelt by him. He then thinks that he can
                                    give it to Magnolia
                                    now.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet, he also thinks of something. Aside from his feeling of
                                    gratitude for Magnolia,
                                    he realizes that he should also thank her parents as well as Oleander&mdash;the
                                    people who were always with
                                    Magnolia and made her happy. He picks some flowers from the bouquet, so he can also
                                    put them on the other
                                    graves of Magnolia&#39;s parents and husband. Lastly, he put the flowers which are
                                    still in the bouquet on
                                    Magnolia&#39;s.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After he finishes, he turns around and then walks away. That
                                    night, he decides to go
                                    back to the inn since now he really needs to eat something. He also plans to stay a
                                    night there before he
                                    leaves this place tomorrow morning. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">A week later, Oliver arrives at his home in the evening. He
                                    is welcomed by Ivie who
                                    abruptly runs to him, hugging him tightly. &quot;Where have you been?! How could you
                                    leave me alone with
                                    only a little note!&quot; Cries Ivie. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oliver is slightly surprised by her abrupt action, but he
                                    rubs his sister&#39;s back.
                                    &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ivie. It&#39;s just an urgent business.&quot; Ivie doesn&#39;t
                                    reply and still hugs
                                    him. So, Oliver continues, &quot;But, let&#39;s prepare and eat our dinner now. I
                                    think I&#39;m
                                    hungry.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ivie releases her hug, and asks, &quot;God, what kind of
                                    business can make you want
                                    to join me for dinner?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Oliver replies, &quot;I won&#39;t skip the meals again,
                                    especially with you. I
                                    don&#39;t want to let go of anything good for me.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ivie giggles right after she listens to Oliver&#39;s reply.
                                    She adds, &quot;You say
                                    as if you&#39;ve just lost something good from your life.&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c1">After hearing her words, Oliver just smiles while witnessing
                                    her sister walk away to
                                    the kitchen to prepare their dinner.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
