                                        “Why this orphanage?” Landora asked him “Because I want it, and today’s is my
                                        schedule to come and visiting them” “How long have you doing these social

                    except a strange feeling and a hesitation to smile back. Eventually, I grew a little stiff smile
                    before I
                    rushed to the kitchen to bring a glass of water for him, as my mother ordered.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">I came back with a glass of water. It was so full that the water inside
                    almost
                    spilled&mdash;wonder why I did this. I walked carefully towards him. I paid full attention to the
                    glass of
                    water in my hands&#39;. None other than because I was afraid Dad would scold me if I spilled
                    it.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c10 c11">Even though he would never.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad, water,&rdquo; no words I could say except those two words. I put
                    that
                    plastic mug on the table in front of my dad.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dad smiled and lifted up the mug. He sipped the water. &ldquo;Thank
                    you,&rdquo; he
                    said while smiling at me. I couldn&rsquo;t help but smile back and retorted with a small yes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your day?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first question my dad always asked me every time we met for the first
                    time after
                    months. Yeah, he chose the usual starting of father-daughter conversation. A daughter will probably
                    be the
                    happiest when her dad asks her that kind of question and begins to share every single thing they do
                    in a
                    day, but I didn&rsquo;t find that daughter in me. I was speechless. I could&rsquo;ve told him a
                    story where
                    boys in my class called me an ugly rhinoceros, where I got an A+ for an English test, how I got a
                    good mark
                    for the first time for Math test, or how I went to school alone by bus because Mom told me
                    to.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c10">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good,&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">But I couldn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Lana! Why did you use a plastic mug?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">I was startled when I heard Mom&rsquo;s exclamation from behind my back. She
                    brought
                    a tiny plate with some pieces of cake that she made to celebrate Dad&rsquo;s homecoming.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I questioned innocently. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Mom took her seat first and put the plate on the table adjacent to the mug.
                    She
                    looked at me with both hands on her wrists. She didn&rsquo;t say anything, just looked at me. I
                    blinked
                    twice, and almost laughed because Mom&rsquo;s facial expression was so funny!</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Lana!&rdquo; Mom exclaimed one more time. At that exact moment, I
                    realized
                    something. I should bring Dad a glass of water with his glass mug!</span></p>
            <p class="c7 c14"><span class="c2">***</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father was a head chef on a fancy cruise ship. Mom said its name was In
                    Deep Ship,
                    but I didn&rsquo;t want to know. He worked not for a day, not for a week, but months. He rarely went
                    home.
                    That was why my relationship with Dad almost as awkward as strangers, and why I always wondered why
                    Mom
                    always asked me to bring a glass of water for him in a glass mug that she claimed to be his favorite
                    mug
                    every time he got back from his work, which was just one month among the twelve months of a year.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like, aren&rsquo;t all mugs at home just as good? That was my thought
                    before.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c10">I quite didn&rsquo;t like it when Dad was home. He was a strict person. He
                    talked a
                    lot. Once he talked, you could never throw even a single word to interrupt unless he let you. Even
                    though he
                    talked a lot, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that he talked about unnecessary things. Well, although I used
                    to think
                    that he talked about such things. But, I realized now that Dad only talked about something
                    important. He was
                    always straight to the point. In conclusion, he talked about many important things.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Lana,&rdquo; that is my name. He called me.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">I was startled that my TV remote was thrown out of my hand. At the same time,
                    our
                    eyes met. Dad was looking sharp, while mine looked at him in full shock.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t slept yet?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">For a second, I went silent, and then I went back to reality. I could feel my
                    heart
                    beating so fast between shock and fear when I saw him folding his arms and leaning against the door
                    of my
                    bedroom.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;D-Dad &hellip;,&rdquo; I mumbled with a stutter, &ldquo;I &hellip; was
                    about
                    to turn the TV off when you came in.&rdquo; I let out an awkward giggle after that.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Dad&rsquo;s rule that I didn&rsquo;t like the most was no TV or electronic
                    activities
                    above 11 PM. It was above 11 PM.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He let out a sigh, &ldquo;Okay, turn off the TV now, Sweetie,&rdquo; he said
                    calmly.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">I went silent again. Dad&rsquo;s voice was low, and he never screamed. Unlike
                    Mom.
                    Mom always screamed whenever I got on her nerves&mdash; and it was understandable&mdash; but Dad was
                    different. Never have in my fourteen years of life I found him screaming at my mom, let alone at me.
                    His
                    voice was so low, yet I knew that every time that voice was out, things could not be denied.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I nodded, turned the TV off and threw myself to the bed. Dad put a little
                    smile on
                    his lips while he was nodding. He then inched out of my bedroom. Before closing the room door, he
                    mumbled,
                    &ldquo;good night, Lana.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I just nodded and said the same thing back to him. Then, he slowly closed the
                    door,
                    as I fell asleep.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;I thought about nights like that. I was dreaming when there was a very
                    gentle
                    caress on my hair, not once, but twice or thrice, also a little kiss on the forehead.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next day, I always found out that Dad was not here. Mom said that he must
                    go back
                    to work, and he did. I didn&rsquo;t give a certain reaction, but deep inside, I felt disappointed.
                    It was
                    always like that. A question in my mind always lingered and left unanswered because I always missed
                    the
                    chance to ask him the question.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad, about last night, did a gentle caress on my hair and a little
                    kiss on my
                    forehead come from you? Or was I dreaming?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That question still lingers. It has been answered now, but with two different
                    answers.</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c10">One day, at the age of fourteen, I came home from school. Just like the
                    other kids
                    at my age, I was happy simply because I finally got back home after spending seven hours at school.
                    I did
                    not lie when I said studying is tiring.</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m home!&rdquo; I screamed excitedly. Just a few steps
                    away until
                    I reach my bed!</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, my steps stopped right when I saw Mom&rsquo;s up and down
                    shoulders
                    along with her rare sobs.</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c10">&nbsp;Excitement had gone away, and in a blink of eyes, it shifted to
                    curiosity and
                    perplexity. I stepped slowly towards her as she didn&rsquo;t react a bit to my voice that called
                    her. I put
                    my hand on her shoulder. It was shaking badly.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had never seen her crying this bad.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening, Mom?&rdquo; I decided to ask. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After minutes of refusing to look at my face, she lifted her face from her
                    deep
                    stoop. My heart ached when I saw Mom&rsquo;s face wet. I could not tell the difference between her
                    tears and
                    her sweat. She looked very sad and exhausted at the same time.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;M-Mom, is everything alright?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t know why I started
                    to get
                    so scared when her eyes met mine.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She shook her head. I froze. Everything is not alright.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mom?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;D-Dad?&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;why? Does it have anything to do with
                    him?
                    Does he let you down, Mom?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I swear if Dad will ever do that to Mom&hellip;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As for now, the search for passengers and crew members is still
                    ongoing.
                    However, it is presumed that no one survived the sinking incident of the US&#39; In Deep Ship cruise
                    ship
                    that sank in the South Pacific Ocean in the country of Chile&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c10">He disappointed us.</span></p>
            <p class="c7"><span class="c2">***</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c10 c11">Love hurts and feels far more precious when you have no time left to
                    show it
                    anymore.</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I was younger, I always wondered why my mother always asked me to bring
                    a glass
                    of water in a glass mug for my father every time he got back after work.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, I know why.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mom always wanted to give the best for Dad in his once-in-a-year homecoming.
                    Dad has
                    his favourite mug that he left at home, and it was the one that was made from glass. A beautiful
                    glass mug
                    that always caught my eyes whenever I went to the kitchen to bring some water for myself that I
                    never wanted
                    to use because it was Dad&rsquo;s favourite. I didn&rsquo;t want to break it.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sweetie, since your dad always comes back home only once in a year, we
                    need to
                    make it special and cherish him. He loves to drink in a glass mug. If he&rsquo;s home, bring him a
                    glass of
                    water using that mug, okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dad was a strict person, and he talked a lot.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lana, do your homework,&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lana, you haven&rsquo;t slept? Turn the TV off and go to sleep.
                    It&rsquo;s
                    late at night. You have to go to school tomorrow,&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lana, no phone. Go to sleep,&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good night, Lana.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I smile. The last thing that he said to me was a good night. His good night
                    was more
                    than enough for me to fall asleep that I couldn&rsquo;t even tell the differences whether the soft
                    caress
                    and a little kiss after were from him or not, were real or just a dream. I always missed the chance
                    to ask
                    him.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad, about last night, did a gentle caress on my hair and a little
                    kiss on my
                    forehead come from you? Or was I &nbsp;dreaming?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That question still lingers. It is answered now, but with two different
                    answers. That
                    question still lingers, but Dad is not the one who answers.</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He really loves you,
                    Sweetie.
                    He always checked on you every night. He always wished you a good night and patted you softly. He
                    liked to
                    give you a little kiss,&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it was not a
                    dream.</span></p>
            <p class="c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3 c13"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, Mom. He really
                    loves me.
                    He still checks on me every night. I can hear him whispering to me good night and patting my hair
                    softly. He
                    still places a kiss on my forehead.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is now in every
                    dream.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad, if I knew that you would
                    leave
                    me for eternity and if I knew it would be this hurt, I would welcome your homecoming with a bright
                    smile, a
                    warm hug, and a tight grip on both of your hands. I would bring you a glass of water in your
                    favourite glass
                    mug without being clueless. I would tell you every single thing about my day. I would wait until you
                    gave me
                    a soft caress and a little kiss after a good night. I would give you the exact same things.</span>

            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s been four years.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">I let the memories between Dad and I back in the days become a series of
                    wonderful
                    memories. Dad once told me that we don&rsquo;t want to live an impossible dream. Though I missed
                    every
                    moment I shared with Dad, I knew that it could never be rewound unless in my own mind. Yet, they
                    could never
                    be forgotten. If anyone asked me what my goal in life was? It was not much. I only had Mom in this
                    world
                    along with Dad in my heart, so I wanted to make them smile happily. I wanted to follow what my dad
                    told me
                    and what my mom told me. I would bring Dad&rsquo;s favourite flowers and pour water on his house for
                    these
                    four years. It would bloom beautifully, so Dad would never be thirsty up there. Dad would come to my
                    dream
                    and say &ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; just like when I brought him a glass of water every time he got
                    back home,
                    so I would retort with a cheerful &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Oh, and one other little thing.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">I wanted to write a whole story about my dad and water in a glass mug for
                    him.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">It had been four years.</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ms.

            </p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood up as a high-pitched
                    voice
                    called me. A lady smiled at me while holding sheets of paper in her left hand. She stretched out her
                    right
                    hand at me.</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome to Hope
                    University,&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, I could not
                    speak a
                    single word properly. I found my right hand reaching hers, and she immediately shook it.</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m sorry,
                    Ma&rsquo;am, but can you &hellip;,&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She let out a smile,
                    &ldquo;Congratulations, you have been qualified to be the new student of Hope University in your
                    selected
                    major. You will begin to study here in August.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">I smiled. I could sense the urge to cry as I felt my throat choked up, and a
                    bunch of
                    blurred water blocked my eyesight, but no. I would not cry. He told me every night to always smile,
                    and you
                    know, every time that voice was out, things could not be denied. </span></p>

                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">It was four in the afternoon. I went back home after a long and tiring
                        day at
                        school. Rode a motorcycle through the woods makes my mind a little bit calmer after this tiring
                        day. I
                        enjoyed this small and short moment for a while to the fullest. The breeze touched my skin, and
                        it felt so
                        nice. The sound of the motorcycle engine that is not too loud was pleasing to hear. The scenery
                        consists of
                        the tree as far as the eyes can see were mesmerizing. The best part was that I was alone, riding
                        the
                        motorcycle heading back home with no one to bother. While it was peaceful, I felt a little
                        uneasy. A sudden
                        chill ran down my spine for less than a second. I paid it no mind so it wouldn&rsquo;t bother my
                        peaceful
                        time. I could see the end of that scenery. I knew that I was getting close to home, and I knew
                        that this
                        peaceful moment had come to an end.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I could see the house complex from the corner of my eyes as the
                        scenery of the
                        woods passed. My mind, which was at peace and chill, went back to having a distress due as I got
                        closer to
                        my house. Memories about this morning came back, bothered me again and again. The closer I got
                        to my house,
                        the more the memories replayed in my head, making me remember every detail about what happened
                        this morning
                        at my house. Passing the house complex gate, I rode slowly to my house while calming myself
                        down, ensuring
                        that everything would be all right and there was nothing to worry. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">R through the complex made me realize that things were quieter than
                        usual.
                        Usually, you could see that there were a lot of people on the outside doing something, like kids
                        playing,
                        few people running, or people coming back home after a long day at work. There were not many
                        people here,
                        just a few of them. It was odd especially considering that it was in the afternoon now. Looking
                        up at the
                        sky, I realized that the sky was getting dark, not only because it was almost night but also
                        because the
                        clouds were gathering. The rain was coming. I headed back to my house and immediately set aside
                        my thoughts
                        about what was about to happen once I arrived.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I saw that the house was pretty quiet once I arrived. There were no
                        cars to be
                        seen, which made me conclude that my parents were currently away for now. I unlocked the gate
                        and went
                        inside, parking my motorcycle. I locked the gate again to ensure no one would get in, especially
                        when it was
                        almost night and rain was about to come. I took a look at my house again before going inside,
                        and yeah, the
                        house was pretty much empty. I looked at my phone to see if my mom left any messages for me
                        about where she
                        went. And I found it.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;We will have dinner with our father&#39;s boss. We&rsquo;ll be
                        home late.
                        There is food in the fridge for your dinner. Take care.&rdquo; It was her message. Pretty
                        straight forward.
                        It Made sense, considering what happened this morning. It must be pretty awkward for her to make
                        a kind and
                        nice message, so she went with a simple one. I put back my phone in my pocket, picked up a key,
                        unlocked the
                        door, and headed inside. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I stepped inside the house, I saw how dark the house was. Not only the
                        lamps were
                        off, the light from outside was barely reaching the house due to the rain. I could barely see
                        anything at
                        all. It almost scared me. I </span><span class="c2">shuted</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;and
                        locked the
                        door. I went straight to turn on every lamp in the house. When did so, I noticed that there was
                        one lamp
                        near my parents bedroom that did not turn on at all, broken. We haven&rsquo;t changed it at all
                        since a few
                        months for no reason at all. I also turned the lamp outside the house because it&rsquo;ll be
                        raining in a
                        moment. All the lamps, except the one near my parents room were on, and the rain had started.
                    </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The house was pretty quiet. The only noise that I could hear came from
                        the rain
                        outside. I went straight to my room to put my stuff in it. I took my towel and went to the
                        bathroom. It was
                        a nice shower with warm water that made me relax after a long tiring day. It was nice, peaceful
                        despite the
                        rain outside, not too quiet and not too loud either. After a 15 minutes bath, I dried myself up
                        and headed
                        out of the bathroom. There the mood changed drastically from before. I could still hear the rain
                        outside,
                        and it was very loud, but inside my house, it was very quiet. This situation creeped me out, so
                        I went to
                        turn on the tv so that there would be some noise. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I put on some clothes after taking a bath. It was raining, and the
                        temperature was
                        cold, so I went with some long sleeve shirts and long pants. After getting dressed up, I went to
                        the kitchen
                        to grab something to eat for dinner. I remember that mom left something for me in the fridge. I
                        opened the
                        fridge only to find a pudding. It was kinda a letdown. How come a mother only left her son a
                        pudding for
                        dinner, in the middle of the rain? It pissed me off for some reason. But since there was nothing
                        left to
                        eat, I went along with it. I sat at the dining table, ate the pudding. The pudding was all right
                        and nothing
                        special. The atmosphere was rather quiet, even though it was raining outside, and I turned on
                        the tv. Noisy
                        but somehow still quiet. Sitting in the dining room reminds me of the fight I had with my
                        parents this
                        morning. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Sitting here makes me remember how it happened. How my father told me
                        to get
                        serious about my future, and how my mother worried about the people I was hanging out with. It
                        happened for
                        a while, like about a month, and we had this talk almost every day. Hearing it many times made
                        me tired of
                        this talk, this family, and this house, as a whole. It made me want to run away as far as
                        possible. And
                        today, this morning, I accidentally broke the plate when we had that discourse. It left my
                        parents shocked,
                        and I went to school immediately. Even though I wanted to run away, there was no place where I
                        could run to.
                    </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">After I finished my dinner, I went to wash my hands. Suddenly, the
                        electricity
                        went down. The house that was full of light and bright went dark, this house that was full of
                        the sound of
                        tv went quiet. The only sound I can hear is the sound of the rain from outside. I was shocked by
                        the sudden
                        power down that made me not move for a few seconds. I pulled myself together and cooled my
                        thoughts. I went
                        to look for a candle to give some light to this room. I lit it up using the lighter as soon as I
                        found one.
                        I light up about three candles, one near the entrance door, one for the living room, and another
                        one is for
                        my bedroom. The light from the candle is not too bright. There are many parts of the room that
                        were still
                        covered by the darkness. This darkness gave me creeps. Better to stay in my bedroom.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Knock, Knock!&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">I heard a knocking sound coming from outside the house. It was really
                        loud and
                        scared me. I braved myself to look over the window to see if there was anything outside making
                        that sound. I
                        looked over and saw nothing. I thought that maybe it was just a tree branch knocking on the
                        window or the
                        wall of my house, even though it was impossible to make such loud sounds. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Knock, knock!&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;I heard it again when I walked to my bedroom. I tried to ignore
                        it, but the
                        knock got louder. So I chose to go back to the kitchen to see it, and still nothing to be seen
                        from outside.
                        I grabbed a knife to keep myself safe. When I turned around to the window, I saw a shadow figure
                        outside the
                        window. It was big, resembling a person, and I could tell that it was looking directly at me
                        even though I
                        couldn&#39;t see its eyes. I ran to my bedroom, locked myself in it, waited for the electricity
                        to go on
                        again and for my parents to come home. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The knocking noise lasted not too long and eventually went away after
                        a while. I
                        tried to look out the window in my bedroom and saw nothing different, it was still raining
                        outside, and the
                        shadow figure was nowhere to be seen. Not long after that, the power went on. I sighed in a
                        sense of relief
                        that I no longer have to be scared of the power down in the rain now.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Thumb!&rdquo; A sound coming from outside my bedroom sounds
                        like a door
                        being closed. It surprised me a little bit, but it seems that my parents are home. Weird, I did
                        not hear the
                        sound of the car at all. I went outside to check it out. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">As I arrived outside my bedroom, I saw my parents were at the
                        entrance. They were
                        taking off their shoes and putting them on the shoe shelf. I wanted to say something like,
                        &#39;welcome
                        home&#39; to them, but I decided not to for some reason. Instead, it was my mom who started the
                        conversation,</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;oh hey sweetheart, sorry we are home late, and have you eaten
                        your
                        dinner?&rdquo; Said my mom. I nodded to her so that she knew I had eaten it. No words came from
                        my father.
                        He just took off his shoes, put down umbrella, and went on to the dining room. Mother also did
                        the same
                        thing. She went to the dining room as well. They were acting kind of weird, or maybe they were
                        just hungry.
                        After they left, I noticed something weird near the door. There was no sign of water dripping at
                        all. It was
                        raining outside, and this rain should have made their clothes wet even with an umbrella. Half of
                        the
                        umbrella was wet, and the shoes were completely dry. The ground you stepped on should have made
                        your shoes
                        wet, and theirs were not at all. Knowing things were getting weirder, I tried to look at the
                        window near the
                        entrance to see the car. I did not hear the sound of the gate and the car when they got home. I
                        tried to get
                        to the window slowly, not sure what I wanted to look at there. My heart was beating really fast.
                        I was
                        bathing in sweat due to fear and nervousness, and my hands were shaking as I got closer to the
                        window.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;What are you doing there, Sweetheart?&rdquo; I flinched after
                        hearing a
                        voice coming from behind me. I turned back to see that it was my mom. I was catching my breath
                        for a while
                        after that shock. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I replied to her question.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Oh, ok, can you come to the dining room? We need to talk,
                        hurry! Your
                        father is waiting for you,&rdquo; she said. Her tone was serious. It was like demand and would
                        not receive
                        no as an answer. Her eyes stared at me, waiting for my answer. I nodded as my answer, and she
                        headed to the
                        dining room. Considering how serious they were about this talk, it was probably about what
                        happened this
                        morning. I should have known I could not escape so easily. I braced myself and went to the
                        kitchen to finish
                        this problem while completely forgetting what I was trying to do. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Quiet, waiting for a conversation to begin, the ramble, letting all
                        out. As I
                        entered the dining room, the situation was very quiet. Only my parents who sat at the dining
                        table waiting
                        for me, and there was nothing on the table, not even food. The only noise you could hear was the
                        rain
                        outside. I sat down and waited for them to start a conversation. For a while, there are no words
                        that come
                        from our mouths, just quiet with no one to start talking. Unable to handle the quiet, I started
                        talking.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Is this about what happened this morning?&rdquo; I asked them,
                        and they
                        looked at me while thinking of a response, &ldquo;as I said back then, I still don&rsquo;t know
                        what I want
                        to do for my future. Please stop forcing me to do something that I haven&rsquo;t decided yet.
                        I&rsquo;m
                        tired of hearing you guys keep telling me to think about my future when I keep thinking about
                        it. The
                        friends I hung out with are also helping me. They are not bad guys. So please, don&rsquo;t talk
                        about
                        something you guys don&rsquo;t know about, and I&#39;m sorry for the broken plate,&rdquo; I
                        continued. I let
                        it all out about what I wanted to say. I hoped that it would make them understand. I looked at
                        them to see
                        their response, and their faces did not show angry expressions. It was a relief. Are they happy
                        with my
                        answer?</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;We understand, son, and we are sorry for being angry this whole
                        time,&rdquo; said my dad. He apologized for the thing he had said to me. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;We are sorry for forcing you to do what we want,&rdquo; said my
                        mom. The
                        apology they said made me happy to the point tears appeared in my eyes. After the long fight we
                        had, maybe
                        we could go back to how it used to be, a normal happy family.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Would you forgive us after what we did to you?&rdquo; my mother
                        continued.
                        I nodded without hesitation because I wanted nothing more than a happy family. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Thank you, and I&rsquo;m sorry as well,&rdquo; I said to
                        them.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">They looked happy when I said that. Those words that came from my
                        mouth were
                        something that I always wanted to say to them, that I was happy to be their son, and I was glad
                        they were my
                        parents. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Knock, Knock!&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I heard a familiar sound again. The room fell into sudden silence. My
                        parents were
                        looking in the direction where the entrance is. I was looking at it as well. That was the same
                        noise I heard
                        not too long ago.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Sweetheart, can you go check on the door? There might be a
                        guest,&rdquo;
                        said my mother.</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">A guest? In the middle of the rain? Were they serious about it? I
                        nodded to them
                        and went to the entrance to see it by myself. Probably because they were there, I was brave
                        enough to check
                        it. On the way to the entrance from the dining room, it was really quiet, but as soon as I got
                        near it, I
                        heard another sound. The sound itself sounds rough. It was a car engine sound. And another thing
                        I heard was
                        the voice of a woman. </span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Sweetheart, we are home! Can you open the door
                        please?&rdquo;</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">That was the thing I heard. It was my mom&#39;s voice. It was her
                        voice coming
                        from outside. I checked the window near the entrance to see it, and I saw her with an umbrella
                        waiting for
                        the door to open. Another thing I saw was my parents&#39; car with my father in it. From the
                        look of it, it
                        was like they just arrived home. But how could that be? They just arrived back then. How come
                        there was
                        another of my parents? How was this even possible? A realization hit me of what happened. The
                        one that came
                        first was never my parents. The water drip, and dry shoes. I then realized it. I was sweating
                        like crazy,
                        and my body was shaking to the truth I just discovered. The one that I talked to was not my
                        parents. They
                        were-</span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Sweetheart, what are you doing here?&rdquo; A hand touched my
                        shoulder. At
                        that moment, I understood something. That thing was just too good to be true. </span></p>
