I am happy to knowing you were here with me” “Okay, I will answered your questions before about why am I doing and passing my life like these?” She nodded “Because of you Landora, you are my inspiration why I passing my life like this” “Me? Why me?” “as I talked before, I know you since you were child. Since our first meeting, I always follow wherever you go, whatever your activities I know it Landora” “But, why you never coming and meets me, Jacob?” 
                “firstly, because you always sad and I don’t know how the way to make you happy and comfort with me. Second, when I know the way my father asked me to leaving this country and continue my study in Poland” “Now, how you comeback and deny your father?” “I decide to taking care of my desire to be a Pilot. And I think I can finishing my school here and continue after these” Landora keep listening Jacob explanation 
                “I know it Landora, you decide to follow your monochromatic life, you never follow your dreams and always depressing yourself. Don’t blame yourself for something that you never done before, you deserve to be happy!” with trembling voice she is crying and said “I can’t Jacob!!! Happiness is not mine!!!” Jacob hugs Landora and whisper “That’s not right, you must be happy to make your parents happy up there. 
                I know however you try it nobody will respect you but pleaseee just do it for yourself not for others people, Landora” “may I Jacob?” they looking each other “Please be my home, when I want back” “yes I have your home” They life begin from that day.<br><br>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">It was four in the afternoon. I went back home after a long and tiring day at
            school. Rode a motorcycle through the woods makes my mind a little bit calmer after this tiring day. I
            enjoyed this small and short moment for a while to the fullest. The breeze touched my skin, and it felt so
            nice. The sound of the motorcycle engine that is not too loud was pleasing to hear. The scenery consists of
            the tree as far as the eyes can see were mesmerizing. The best part was that I was alone, riding the
            motorcycle heading back home with no one to bother. While it was peaceful, I felt a little uneasy. A sudden
            chill ran down my spine for less than a second. I paid it no mind so it wouldn&rsquo;t bother my peaceful
            time. I could see the end of that scenery. I knew that I was getting close to home, and I knew that this
            peaceful moment had come to an end.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I could see the house complex from the corner of my eyes as the scenery of the
            woods passed. My mind, which was at peace and chill, went back to having a distress due as I got closer to
            my house. Memories about this morning came back, bothered me again and again. The closer I got to my house,
            the more the memories replayed in my head, making me remember every detail about what happened this morning
            at my house. Passing the house complex gate, I rode slowly to my house while calming myself down, ensuring
            that everything would be all right and there was nothing to worry. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">R through the complex made me realize that things were quieter than usual.
            Usually, you could see that there were a lot of people on the outside doing something, like kids playing,
            few people running, or people coming back home after a long day at work. There were not many people here,
            just a few of them. It was odd especially considering that it was in the afternoon now. Looking up at the
            sky, I realized that the sky was getting dark, not only because it was almost night but also because the
            clouds were gathering. The rain was coming. I headed back to my house and immediately set aside my thoughts
            about what was about to happen once I arrived.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I saw that the house was pretty quiet once I arrived. There were no cars to be
            seen, which made me conclude that my parents were currently away for now. I unlocked the gate and went
            inside, parking my motorcycle. I locked the gate again to ensure no one would get in, especially when it was
            almost night and rain was about to come. I took a look at my house again before going inside, and yeah, the
            house was pretty much empty. I looked at my phone to see if my mom left any messages for me about where she
            went. And I found it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;We will have dinner with our father&#39;s boss. We&rsquo;ll be home late.
            There is food in the fridge for your dinner. Take care.&rdquo; It was her message. Pretty straight forward.
            It Made sense, considering what happened this morning. It must be pretty awkward for her to make a kind and
            nice message, so she went with a simple one. I put back my phone in my pocket, picked up a key, unlocked the
            door, and headed inside. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2">As I stepped inside the house, I saw how dark the house was. Not only the lamps were
            off, the light from outside was barely reaching the house due to the rain. I could barely see anything at
            all. It almost scared me. I </span><span class="c2">shuted</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;and locked the
            door. I went straight to turn on every lamp in the house. When did so, I noticed that there was one lamp
            near my parents bedroom that did not turn on at all, broken. We haven&rsquo;t changed it at all since a few
            months for no reason at all. I also turned the lamp outside the house because it&rsquo;ll be raining in a
            moment. All the lamps, except the one near my parents room were on, and the rain had started. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The house was pretty quiet. The only noise that I could hear came from the rain
            outside. I went straight to my room to put my stuff in it. I took my towel and went to the bathroom. It was
            a nice shower with warm water that made me relax after a long tiring day. It was nice, peaceful despite the
            rain outside, not too quiet and not too loud either. After a 15 minutes bath, I dried myself up and headed
            out of the bathroom. There the mood changed drastically from before. I could still hear the rain outside,
            and it was very loud, but inside my house, it was very quiet. This situation creeped me out, so I went to
            turn on the tv so that there would be some noise. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I put on some clothes after taking a bath. It was raining, and the temperature was
            cold, so I went with some long sleeve shirts and long pants. After getting dressed up, I went to the kitchen
            to grab something to eat for dinner. I remember that mom left something for me in the fridge. I opened the
            fridge only to find a pudding. It was kinda a letdown. How come a mother only left her son a pudding for
            dinner, in the middle of the rain? It pissed me off for some reason. But since there was nothing left to
            eat, I went along with it. I sat at the dining table, ate the pudding. The pudding was all right and nothing
            special. The atmosphere was rather quiet, even though it was raining outside, and I turned on the tv. Noisy
            but somehow still quiet. Sitting in the dining room reminds me of the fight I had with my parents this
            morning. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Sitting here makes me remember how it happened. How my father told me to get
            serious about my future, and how my mother worried about the people I was hanging out with. It happened for
            a while, like about a month, and we had this talk almost every day. Hearing it many times made me tired of
            this talk, this family, and this house, as a whole. It made me want to run away as far as possible. And
            today, this morning, I accidentally broke the plate when we had that discourse. It left my parents shocked,
            and I went to school immediately. Even though I wanted to run away, there was no place where I could run to.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">After I finished my dinner, I went to wash my hands. Suddenly, the electricity
            went down. The house that was full of light and bright went dark, this house that was full of the sound of
            tv went quiet. The only sound I can hear is the sound of the rain from outside. I was shocked by the sudden
            power down that made me not move for a few seconds. I pulled myself together and cooled my thoughts. I went
            to look for a candle to give some light to this room. I lit it up using the lighter as soon as I found one.
            I light up about three candles, one near the entrance door, one for the living room, and another one is for
            my bedroom. The light from the candle is not too bright. There are many parts of the room that were still
            covered by the darkness. This darkness gave me creeps. Better to stay in my bedroom.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Knock, Knock!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">I heard a knocking sound coming from outside the house. It was really loud and
            scared me. I braved myself to look over the window to see if there was anything outside making that sound. I
            looked over and saw nothing. I thought that maybe it was just a tree branch knocking on the window or the
            wall of my house, even though it was impossible to make such loud sounds. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Knock, knock!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;I heard it again when I walked to my bedroom. I tried to ignore it, but the
            knock got louder. So I chose to go back to the kitchen to see it, and still nothing to be seen from outside.
            I grabbed a knife to keep myself safe. When I turned around to the window, I saw a shadow figure outside the
            window. It was big, resembling a person, and I could tell that it was looking directly at me even though I
            couldn&#39;t see its eyes. I ran to my bedroom, locked myself in it, waited for the electricity to go on
            again and for my parents to come home. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The knocking noise lasted not too long and eventually went away after a while. I
            tried to look out the window in my bedroom and saw nothing different, it was still raining outside, and the
            shadow figure was nowhere to be seen. Not long after that, the power went on. I sighed in a sense of relief
            that I no longer have to be scared of the power down in the rain now.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Thumb!&rdquo; A sound coming from outside my bedroom sounds like a door
            being closed. It surprised me a little bit, but it seems that my parents are home. Weird, I did not hear the
            sound of the car at all. I went outside to check it out. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">As I arrived outside my bedroom, I saw my parents were at the entrance. They were
            taking off their shoes and putting them on the shoe shelf. I wanted to say something like, &#39;welcome
            home&#39; to them, but I decided not to for some reason. Instead, it was my mom who started the
            conversation,</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;oh hey sweetheart, sorry we are home late, and have you eaten your
            dinner?&rdquo; Said my mom. I nodded to her so that she knew I had eaten it. No words came from my father.
            He just took off his shoes, put down umbrella, and went on to the dining room. Mother also did the same
            thing. She went to the dining room as well. They were acting kind of weird, or maybe they were just hungry.
            After they left, I noticed something weird near the door. There was no sign of water dripping at all. It was
            raining outside, and this rain should have made their clothes wet even with an umbrella. Half of the
            umbrella was wet, and the shoes were completely dry. The ground you stepped on should have made your shoes
            wet, and theirs were not at all. Knowing things were getting weirder, I tried to look at the window near the
            entrance to see the car. I did not hear the sound of the gate and the car when they got home. I tried to get
            to the window slowly, not sure what I wanted to look at there. My heart was beating really fast. I was
            bathing in sweat due to fear and nervousness, and my hands were shaking as I got closer to the
            window.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;What are you doing there, Sweetheart?&rdquo; I flinched after hearing a
            voice coming from behind me. I turned back to see that it was my mom. I was catching my breath for a while
            after that shock. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I replied to her question.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Oh, ok, can you come to the dining room? We need to talk, hurry! Your
            father is waiting for you,&rdquo; she said. Her tone was serious. It was like demand and would not receive
            no as an answer. Her eyes stared at me, waiting for my answer. I nodded as my answer, and she headed to the
            dining room. Considering how serious they were about this talk, it was probably about what happened this
            morning. I should have known I could not escape so easily. I braced myself and went to the kitchen to finish
            this problem while completely forgetting what I was trying to do. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Quiet, waiting for a conversation to begin, the ramble, letting all out. As I
            entered the dining room, the situation was very quiet. Only my parents who sat at the dining table waiting
            for me, and there was nothing on the table, not even food. The only noise you could hear was the rain
            outside. I sat down and waited for them to start a conversation. For a while, there are no words that come
            from our mouths, just quiet with no one to start talking. Unable to handle the quiet, I started
            talking.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Is this about what happened this morning?&rdquo; I asked them, and they
            looked at me while thinking of a response, &ldquo;as I said back then, I still don&rsquo;t know what I want
            to do for my future. Please stop forcing me to do something that I haven&rsquo;t decided yet. I&rsquo;m
            tired of hearing you guys keep telling me to think about my future when I keep thinking about it. The
            friends I hung out with are also helping me. They are not bad guys. So please, don&rsquo;t talk about
            something you guys don&rsquo;t know about, and I&#39;m sorry for the broken plate,&rdquo; I continued. I let
            it all out about what I wanted to say. I hoped that it would make them understand. I looked at them to see
            their response, and their faces did not show angry expressions. It was a relief. Are they happy with my
            answer?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;We understand, son, and we are sorry for being angry this whole
            time,&rdquo; said my dad. He apologized for the thing he had said to me. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;We are sorry for forcing you to do what we want,&rdquo; said my mom. The
            apology they said made me happy to the point tears appeared in my eyes. After the long fight we had, maybe
            we could go back to how it used to be, a normal happy family.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Would you forgive us after what we did to you?&rdquo; my mother continued.
            I nodded without hesitation because I wanted nothing more than a happy family. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Thank you, and I&rsquo;m sorry as well,&rdquo; I said to them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">They looked happy when I said that. Those words that came from my mouth were
            something that I always wanted to say to them, that I was happy to be their son, and I was glad they were my
            parents. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Knock, Knock!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I heard a familiar sound again. The room fell into sudden silence. My parents were
            looking in the direction where the entrance is. I was looking at it as well. That was the same noise I heard
            not too long ago.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Sweetheart, can you go check on the door? There might be a guest,&rdquo;
            said my mother.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">A guest? In the middle of the rain? Were they serious about it? I nodded to them
            and went to the entrance to see it by myself. Probably because they were there, I was brave enough to check
            it. On the way to the entrance from the dining room, it was really quiet, but as soon as I got near it, I
            heard another sound. The sound itself sounds rough. It was a car engine sound. And another thing I heard was
            the voice of a woman. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Sweetheart, we are home! Can you open the door please?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">That was the thing I heard. It was my mom&#39;s voice. It was her voice coming
            from outside. I checked the window near the entrance to see it, and I saw her with an umbrella waiting for
            the door to open. Another thing I saw was my parents&#39; car with my father in it. From the look of it, it
            was like they just arrived home. But how could that be? They just arrived back then. How come there was
            another of my parents? How was this even possible? A realization hit me of what happened. The one that came
            first was never my parents. The water drip, and dry shoes. I then realized it. I was sweating like crazy,
            and my body was shaking to the truth I just discovered. The one that I talked to was not my parents. They
            were-</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Sweetheart, what are you doing here?&rdquo; A hand touched my shoulder. At
            that moment, I understood something. That thing was just too good to be true. </span></p>
    <p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p>
