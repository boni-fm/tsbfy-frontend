                Ara, wait!&quot; Lia shouted from the end of the corridor towards Ara.
                        &quot;Why are you walking so fast? My legs are shot.&quot; Lia said curtly. Seeing Ara&#39;s
                        flat expression, Lia fell silent because she realized that something was wrong. &quot;Ra, what
                        happened? Is there anything wrong?&quot; Lia asked. Ara still didn&#39;t pay attention to her
                        words, but still walked hand in hand with Lia to their classroom. From the class bell ringing
                        until the recess bell rang, Ara just stared out the window absentmindedly. Lia, who was her
                        seatmate, could only stay silent and wait for Ara&#39;s response to her remarks earlier. Dinda
                        and Yara, who are friends behind their bench, are also confused by Ara&#39;s attitude. Dinda
                        poked Lia&#39;s back, then coded her &#39;what&#39;s wrong?&#39; eye glance. Lia just shrugged
                        her shoulders, pursed her lips down, and hinted &#39;don&#39;t know&#39; to Dinda. Ara&#39;s
                        three best friends could only stay silent and wonder about Ara&#39;s different behavior from
                        usual days.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What happened with Ara? She&rsquo;s dumbfounded like a crazy person.&quot;
                        Yara said to Dinda and Lia when the three of them were in the bathroom on the second floor.
                        &quot;I don&#39;t know, Yar. I&#39;ve asked before but no response.&quot; Answered Lia. Seeing
                        Lia&#39;s response, Yara and Dinda could only glance at them. Finally they approached Ara who
                        had been alone in class to accompany her. &quot;Ara, what happened? Tell us! We&#39;re so
                        confused,&quot; said Dinda to Ara who only clasped her hands and glanced out the window.
                        &ldquo;Okta-&rdquo; Ara opened her mouth, then closed it again. The three friends, who had been
                        curious about waiting for Ara&#39;s answer, were finally annoyed and irritated. &quot;What? Why
                        Octa? Isn&#39;t he the one you have liked since 10th grade? What happened to him?&rdquo; Yara
                        said impatiently towards Ara. With a sad tone, like she wanted to cry, Ara answered &quot;Okta
                        and Elsa are now official.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Lia, Dinda, and Yara were shocked. &quot;Huh, are you serious?! You&rsquo;re
                        joking right?&quot; Lia said not believing Ara&#39;s words. Finally Ara&#39;s tears broke, but
                        Dinda and Yara laughed out loud hearing this. &quot;Why are you laughing? I liked Okta first,
                        why did he end up with Elsa anyway?!&rdquo; Ara said while sobbing. &quot;No, it&#39;s nothing,
                        but you&#39;re pretty dumb too.&quot; Dinda said laughing. &quot;What do you mean!&quot;
                        Ara&#39;s reply was getting hotter. &quot;Of course, ra. Do you think there&#39;s only Okta in
                        this school? It&#39;s okay.&quot; Yara&#39;s response continued Dinda&#39;s words. &quot;Relax
                        first,&quot; said Lia, &quot;Have you told Okta that you like him?&quot; Lia asked. &quot;Not
                        yet.&quot; Ara replied, shaking her head as she continued to cry. &ldquo;JEHHHH!!&rdquo; Lia,
                        Dinda, and Yara simultaneously responded to Ara&#39;s stupidity. &quot;No wonder Okta shot his
                        chance on Elsa, he doesn&#39;t even know that you like him.&quot; Yara said. &quot;The rule is
                        if you like one person, just say it! Don&#39;t bother trying to cover up everything.&quot;
                        Connect Dinda. Ara sobbed while looking at the three of them. Her red eyes and snot flowing
                        through Ara&#39;s nose made Lia, Dinda and Yara laughing out loud. &quot;Guys, don&#39;t
                        laugh!&quot; Said Ara who was sobbing while laughing too.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c4">&quot;Eh ra, Okta is really handsome. But there are still MANY handsome people in
                        this school. You&#39;re an idiot if you just cry for him.&quot; said Lia. Ara responded
                        &ldquo;But right-&rdquo;, &ldquo;No buts.&rdquo; Reply to Dinda. After Yara gave a tissue to
                        clean Ara&#39;s eyes and nose, Dinda suddenly said something unexpected. &quot;I heard that
                        there is an ipa child who likes you.&quot; Dinda said, teasing Ara. &quot;Huh, I swear? Who
                        isn&#39;t?!&quot; Lia said curiously. &quot;Yes, din, don&#39;t hang like that, like doi.&quot;
                        Connect Yara. Lia answered with fiery eyes &ldquo;His name is Dino, if I&#39;m not mistaken,
                        yes. He said it was our generation. But I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s what he said
                        huh&hellip;&rdquo; Dinda said, still teasing Ara. Ara, who had stopped crying, looked at Dinda
                        with a sad-puppy facial expression and said, &ldquo;Who? I don&rsquo;t know him.&quot; Dinda was
                        amused to see Ara&#39;s expression, &quot;You are surely a pathetic human being, HAHAHA.&quot;
                        Dinda laughing out loud. &quot;Come on, just move on, ra.&quot; Lia said.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly someone knocked on the classroom door. The four of them looked in the
                        direction where the sound came from. A tall, well-built, handsome-looking boy walked into the
                        classroom and approached the four of them. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Who are you looking for?&quot; Lia asked. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I want to meet Ara.&quot; Said The Boy. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ara raised her right hand. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ara?&quot; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes&quot; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hi, I&rsquo;m Dino.&quot; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Immediately Dinda, Lia, and Yara gasped and looked at each other while smiling.
                        Understanding the situation, the three of them immediately left Ara and Dino in the class,
                        &quot;Guys, let&#39;s go to the canteen first,&quot; said Lia. Ara&#39;s three friends walked
                        out of the classroom smiling and whispering &quot;Speak of the devil, my oh my.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dino noticed Ara&#39;s red eyes and cheeks, &quot;Are you crying?&quot; Ask Dino.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, why?&quot; said Ara, who was too lazy to make small talk in response
                        to Dino. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m just saying, I&#39;ve been watching you since the tenth
                        grade.&quot; Dino said. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;And?&quot; Ara chirps curtly. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve been meaning to say this for a long time. Honestly, I really
                        like you, ra.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ara was silent for a moment. Many things crossed her mind, including how to
                        answer a guy who had just confessed his feelings for her. The girl was silent because she never
                        knew how to respond to the situation. &quot;Anjir, what should I answer?&quot; Ara said in a
                        panic in her heart. He looked towards the classroom door, hoping that someone had come in, or
                        that his friends had returned from the cafeteria. But the atmosphere was very quiet, not to
                        mention Dino who was anxiously waiting for Ara&#39;s answer.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;GOSH, I FORGOT!&quot; Ara shouted instantly, breaking the silence. Dino,
                        who had been silent, was also surprised to hear the girl&#39;s cry. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Uhm- Dino, Mrs. Asri told me to go to the teacher&#39;s room during break
                        time. I&#39;m so sorry, I&#39;m in a hurry.&quot; Ara said as she stood up from her seat and
                        pretended to panic out of the classroom. Dino was confused while smiling to himself seeing the
                        cute behavior of the girl who ran away leaving him alone in that social studies class.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Downstairs, Ara frantically looks for three flocks of lambs (aka her best
                        friends) who like to play out and leave as they please. As soon as she saw her three friends
                        from afar, Ara shouted as loudly as possible &ldquo;YOU ARE TRULY! HORRIBLE CHILDS!&rdquo; Dinda
                        was shocked, Yara spilled her drink, and Lia choked on the food she almost managed to swallow.
                </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Why did you get angry? You sound like a debt-collector!&quot; Dinda
                        snapped. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, I spilled my drink!&quot; Yara said, annoyed. While Lia was still
                        coughing hitting her chest, hastily took a drink and took a sip. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t be like that Ra! It hurts my throat.&quot; Said Lia who was still
                        coughing. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Btw, Din, you owe me a debt that hasn&#39;t been returned-&quot; &quot;Yes,
                        come on Yar, I&#39;ll return it-&quot; Dinda answered calming Yara.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Guys, focus!&quot; Ara said, cutting off the conversation of her three
                        friends.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes Ra, what happened? Eh- how was Dino?&quot; Yara asked.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well there he is- how am I going to explain it?&quot; Ara said who wanted
                        to continue her sentence, but was silent.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The four of them were both silent waiting for each other. Annoyed that no one was
                        speaking, Lia said, &ldquo;WHAT ABOUT IT, ARA!? You are always cliffhanging me!&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Why are you upset?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;YOU- you just pissed me off now.&quot; Lia finished her sentence.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What about Dino, ra?&quot; Ask Dinda</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;The guy said that he likes me.&quot; Ara replied in a flat tone.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;HAH?! Are you being serious?&quot; Suddenly the three friends of Ara were
                        shocked and stared in disbelief.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Get it very quickly, you use implants, Ra.&quot; Yara chirps</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hush, don&#39;t talk carelessly Yar.&quot; Lia said</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;It means his love fortune is smooth.&quot; Dinda said</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Eh time? So how are we, Din?&rdquo; Ask Lia</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You really are acutely single, stupid. There have been many who have shot
                        their chances and got rejected.&quot; Dinda replied, annoyed with Lia.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, nothing is right, is it too late? How about you?&quot; Reply
                        Lia</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Still waiting, the best is always on time.&quot; Answer Dinda</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Bullshit, you&#39;re pretentious, Din.&quot; Yara&#39;s response refused to
                        hear Dinda&#39;s words.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah right.&quot; Lia said.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ara, who had been silent for a long time, only listened to her three best
                        friends, who were even busy talking about their love story. &quot;Hey, how about me? I&#39;m
                        panicking!&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What did Dino say earlier?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, he just said, I&#39;ve been watching you since the tenth grade.
                        I&#39;ve been wanting to say this for a long time. Honestly, I like you, ra.&quot; Ara said
                        again Dino&#39;s words were the exact same thing that was said to him.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Then you answer...?&quot; asked Dinda excitedly.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I said Mrs. Asri called me to the teacher&#39;s room, then I pretended to
                        panic and ran out of the classroom.&quot; Ara answered innocently.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s fixed if this-&quot; Lia responded to her friend.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What fixed Li?&quot; asked Ara who was still in her innocent tone.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;REALLY FIX IF YOU ARE A STEWPID!&rdquo; Lia shouted in front of Ara&#39;s
                        face. Instead of being angry, Ara laughed out loud when she saw the expression on her best
                        friend&#39;s face, which was hot when she heard Ara&#39;s response. Dinda and Yara also laughed
                        out loud at the cute way Lia spoke when she was angry. Lia was confused seeing her three friends
                        laughing, finally she herself laughed too.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Li, why do you seem to have a big grudge against Ara?&quot; Dinda
                        giggled.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;After that, I was really annoyed, &#39;&#39; Ara said half-heartedly,
                        &ldquo;how people don&#39;t really wait for her. &#39;&#39; Then it&#39;s annoying, Okta is
                        crying, Dino is hung like that.&quot; Lia said.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, how about Li, I don&#39;t know how to respond. If I refuse, I&#39;m
                        guilty, if I accept, I still have doubts.&quot; Answer Ara. A confused look appeared on
                        Ara&#39;s face. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Yara, Dinda, and Lia understand very well that Ara is not a girl who is
                        experienced in romantic relationships, let alone doesn&#39;t know what &quot;dating&quot;
                        is.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;But do you like Dino?&quot; Dinda asked Ara.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;He is cute. He&rsquo;s really cute actually. He looks like a good guy, I
                        guess.&quot; Digress Ara.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well then, what are you waiting for!&quot; Yara exclaimed.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait a second, think with your brain for once, won&rsquo;t you? First, this
                        is someone else&#39;s child, then if it doesn&#39;t fit the feeling, it is going to be
                        complicated.&quot; Dinda&#39;s response to Yara.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, it&#39;s better if you think about it first. Tell Dino if you need
                        time to think.&quot; Lia gave advice to Ara in the midst of Dinda and Yara who were
                        fighting.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Sometimes your brain is working properly, Li.&quot; Ara said.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, my brain is always working properly, unlike you who have a bug!&quot;
                        Lia responded to her friend&#39;s joke.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The bell resounded loudly throughout the school, signaling that the next lesson
                        was about to begin. The four friends cleaned up the rest of their trash and immediately rushed
                        to the north building, to their class. The rest of the time before the bell rang they spent
                        gossiping and having fun, because the class was empty and the second teacher was absent because
                        of illness.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">After the bell rang, the four best friends were still in class. They deliberately
                        took a long time to tidy up books and stationery because they still wanted to chat and have fun,
                        and did not want to rush home. Unexpectedly, the boy who had approached Ara during lunch break
                        came back to the class. Ara was impressed by the boy&#39;s actions. &quot;I think he is loyal,
                        well&hellip; because he came in here twice.&quot; Dinda whispered to Lia. While Yara just smiled
                        as she looked at Ara, Dino, and her two friends in turn, waiting for what would happen.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dinda felt that Ara would tell Dino that she was still in doubt and needed time
                        to answer. Yara feels that Ara will reject Dino because she still likes Okta. Lia thought that
                        at most Ara would find another reason to avoid.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;How about it?&quot; asked Dino with a face full of hope.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;How about what?&quot; Ara replied with a smile.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;The answer for the lunch-break question...&quot; Dino said, giving a hint
                        of the question Ara would answer.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, I like you too. Let&#39;s date!&quot; Ara replied casually.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;HAH?!&quot; Dinda, Yara, and Lia shouted all together.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p></p>
