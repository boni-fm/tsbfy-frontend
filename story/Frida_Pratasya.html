            <p>
                I still remember it clearly. It was at the end of September in 1603. I
                can still smell the scent of the grass where we both lay that night. I can still see the shadow
                of the trees that hid us from those outsider eyes. I can still feel the breeze running over my
                nightgown and brushing over my hair. I can still hear your small chuckles to every joke I made
                regarding the suggestion for the name of every star that we found that night. It was a very long
                time ago, when I still believed that one star could not decide what would happen to us. It was
                when I still believed that those moments that we spent together would last forever. It was my
                first life.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">Our bond started since we both used to sneak out of the house after
                midnight just to see the stars when they&rsquo;re at their brightest state. It was also the only
                time when one could easily discover a new star that people haven&rsquo;t seen before. We met
                each other at the wasteland a few meters from our backyards. It was him who gave an idea that we
                should do stargazing every Friday in that place which later became our secret spot. The spot was
                basically just a turf that looks safer to lay on than the others. It was surrounded by 20 meters
                pine trees whose shadows were wide enough to hide us from anyone, particularly our parents just
                in case they realized that we weren&rsquo;t home and went to look for us here. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">It was Friday, and we spent that night laying on top of the turf in
                our secret spot just like usual. I wasn&rsquo;t feeling good but still decided to come as I
                didn&rsquo;t want to let him win over me for discovering more stars. The ground felt so cold or
                maybe it was my body&rsquo;s temperature that was too hot. We both silently lay there occupied
                with the sound of our breath. I stared blankly at the black canvas that didn&#39;t look as
                amazing as last week until the red dot suddenly came out and it surprised me as we haven&rsquo;t
                seen that star since last year.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Look! It&rsquo;s your star!&rdquo; I said with a loud
                excitement while pointing my finger to the red dot that was twinkling like it&rsquo;s flexing
                its glow at us.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;My star?&rdquo; he asked with a confused look.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Yes, the red one,&rdquo; I said still with a loud voice.
                &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the unique one, remember?&rdquo; I finally sat down to make sure he remembers
                that star.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c7">Shhh&hellip;</span><span
                class="c3 c2">Don&rsquo;t shout!&rdquo; he said while chuckling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in a
                good condition and you might lose your voice if you keep talking in that tone,&rdquo; he said
                softly. I almost forgot that I was about to faint if it wasn&rsquo;t for the red star that
                suddenly appeared.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c7">Ahhh&hellip;</span><span
                class="c3 c2">sorry! Oh right, you promised to give it a name if you happen to see it again. Now
                that you&rsquo;ve seen it again, you should start to think of names for this red guy!&rdquo; I
                said. &ldquo;Think carefully or I will tease you for it for&hellip;forever!&rdquo; I teased him
                while lightly tapping on his chest. He just smiled and then looked up at the red dot that was
                still twinkling its light to us.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Betelgeuse,&rdquo; He suddenly said.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c7">Huh</span><span class="c3 c2">-?&rdquo;
            </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2 c3">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call it Betelgeuse,&rdquo; he said once more,
                looking at me still with that smile. The name somehow sounds right. </span></p>
        <p class="c11"><span class="c3 c2">***</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I&rsquo;ve lived many lives and this is the sixth time that I woke up
                in a new body and a new era, but still with the same memories. People call it reincarnation
                while I think this is more like a curse. It&rsquo;s hard to have to call different people as
                your mom, dad, sisters, and brothers. The people, places, everything is always changed every
                time I reach the age when I started to understand about the world. They all changed but my
                memories are still the same. It comes rushing over me like the unwanted waves. It drags me with
                its strong current to a lonely shore, where there is only me and my memory which is filled with
                you. I have lived many lives but the only memories that I still remember clearly are the
                memories where there is you in it.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">It sure is hard to live with a bank of memories from your past lives in
                your brain, but I still try my best to enjoy every life that I lived. I have just graduated from
                college and am now trying to find a suitable job for my skill. My friend, Sera, has been
                offering me a promising job in a radio station where she worked. She said if I later decide to
                join her, I will fill in the position where I will be broadcasting about the sky and songs that
                fit the weather. It sounds interesting but the hesitation just won&rsquo;t go away. It&rsquo;s
                not that I am insecure about my physical appearance because thankfully, God is being kind with
                me in this life regarding my look and the only thing I hate about myself in this life is my name
                which seems like it wouldn&rsquo;t let me off of my past memories. Well, I have a slender body
                with shiny shoulder-length black hair, my hazel eyes are not that pretty like the ones that
                people used to draw for an animation character on TV for it has seen many things from hundred
                years ago but it still has the sparks, especially when I think about him. It&rsquo;s also not
                that I am afraid that I will mess up because with hundreds of years of experience, I can easily
                aced every interview that I attend to. It&rsquo;s just&hellip;I have made a promise to myself in
                my last life, which was my fifth life, that I will not give a single damn about stars and
                everything related to it. </span><span class="c2 c7">Stars&hellip;</span><span class="c3 c2">it
                always reminds me of him. </span></p>
        <p class="c0 c10"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a promise under this red star, under the
                Betelgeuse, that as long as it still hasn&rsquo;t lost its glow, we will always find each other.
                No matter what life that we are in, Betelgeuse will help us to connect with each
                other,&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c10"><span class="c3 c2"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">That damn promise that he made, and I agreed to, was a laugh for the
                universe. We got separated right after that moment ended. The fever that I thought was only a
                seasonal fever turned out to be so much worse than that. I left him a week after we made that
                promise and when I woke up, I was a young boy living in a beautiful cottage in the countryside
                near the mountains, it was when his days had already ended. I couldn&rsquo;t grow old with him.
                I didn&rsquo;t know how his life went on after I left. Was he happy and acted like I never
                existed? Or was he also suffering from the grief just like how I feel every time I look up at
                the sky? I will never know. The last four lives that I lived after my first life was all the
                same. I couldn&rsquo;t find him just like how I couldn&rsquo;t find the red dot that usually
                appears in the winter months just after midnight. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">In my last life, I started to think that maybe the star has lost its
                glow and that we could not meet again because of it. I decided to stop believing that the red
                star would appear again and will finally reunite this heart that is missing its half. I prayed
                to God in my last life to stop this curse. I begged Him to end these endless memories of mine
                unless he would make the star shine again that could connect me with him. But the last thing I
                remember after I begged Him for that, I woke up as myself now.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">It&#39;s Friday now, I would be spending my time at the nearest
                rooftop tonight if this is my fifth life. Since I decided to just go on with my life and think
                of it as my first, I&rsquo;ve been staying away from everything related to the stars. Sera
                called me this afternoon and asked me to meet up at the caf&eacute; near her office. It&rsquo;s
                September and the weather has started to shift to winter. I took a cab and went to the
                caf&eacute; where I was supposed to meet Sera. She was already there sitting beside the glass
                window with a tall cup of Americano and her favorite red velvet cake. She has fair skin with
                sparkling green eyes. I would describe it as a beginners&rsquo; eyes, eyes that would show its
                light at every object it lays on. I sat in front of her right after I got there and ordered an
                iced strawberry latte. Not long after that, the waiter came to serve my drink and I immediately
                inhaled it until only half of the glass was left. Sera just watched me while smiling with her
                white teeth and waited until I finished to finally be able to talk to me.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;So, have you made up your mind?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; I asked, pretending not to know what she
                meant.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;The job. You need it, Sky. Think about the stuff that your
                parents still have to pay for you while at this age, you should be the one who pays for their
                stuff!&rdquo; she said, now her tone became serious that I almost couldn&rsquo;t sense the
                sweetness in her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Hey! I&rsquo;ve earned some money okay. Well, not as much as
                you but it is enough for me,&rdquo; I lied.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;What is your reason for turning down my offer now? Last time
                you said you were busy helping your cousin with her pregnancy but now that the baby is born,
                aren&rsquo;t you supposed to just accept my offer? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am not trying to
                nag you here, I am just trying to be a good friend to you,&rdquo; she said. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">She is right, I should just accept her offer regarding the job. I
                can&rsquo;t go on living like this, tied with my past that only gave me more suffering rather
                than happiness. If I decide to live this life like it is my first, then I have to start to focus
                on this life only. To put it simply, I have to act like it is my first time seeing the stars
                every time I look up at the sky.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;&hellip;I guess you&rsquo;re ri-,&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;OF COURSE, I AM!&rdquo; she said, cutting my words with a loud
                voice that made the people who&rsquo;s sitting in that caf&eacute; turn their heads to us.
            </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Sorry! I am just a little too excited. Okay I will arrange
                everything, in the meantime, I have prepared this for you,&rdquo; she said while handing me a
                piece of a black A8 paper.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; I asked her.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A ticket to an art exhibition, I found it online,&rdquo;
            </span><span class="c2 c7">Ohh&hellip;</span><span class="c3 c2">what a sweet gesture, I thought.
                &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this new artist called Arthur, he&rsquo;ll hold the exhibition near my
                office so I thought an unemployed person like you would have many free times to go,&rdquo; she
                replied, well I guess she&rsquo;s not so sweet after all.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;An exhibition? Are you joking?&rdquo; I asked, trying not to
                crawl on the table between us.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Make sure to go there! I don&rsquo;t want my money to go to
                waste, it&rsquo;s also my last requirement for this job offer,&rdquo; she adds with her cunning
                smile. </span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paintings have never
                been my thing since my first life. My hands are too stiff to even hold a painting brush
                properly. I also don&rsquo;t understand a thing about good paintings, I only know colors. But I
                still have to go there if I am serious about this &lsquo;live this life like a first life&rsquo;
                thing. Going to the exhibition is the beginning of that life and hopefully will be my last step
                of walking down the past memory-lane.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The day of the exhibition finally came. It&rsquo;s the 22</span><span
                class="c2 c5">nd</span><span class="c3 c2">&nbsp;of September, the last day of the exhibition
                and it starts at 8 pm until 1 am. I don&rsquo;t know why someone would hold an exhibition in the
                middle of the night, Sera said that the artist stated his reason for that on the website, but I
                don&rsquo;t really care because I only go there just so that I could finally start my new life.
                It feels weird to say the word &lsquo;new&rsquo; over and over again in my head because there is
                nothing new about life for me. Having to remember your last five lives makes you feel like there
                is nothing special anymore about the universe, unless I get to find him in this life but that
                would be impossible since the red star hasn&rsquo;t shown its glow since that night where we
                made a promise under it. The truth is my heart started to believe that the red star, the one who
                will decide our fate whether we can meet again or not won&rsquo;t appear again, but my heart
                also still holds a little hope. That hope is the only thing that keeps me looking up at the sky
                at least once every week, imagining there will be red light twinkling and you suddenly come to
                me with that smile of yours, your deep voice greets me as we both stand under it, but that never
                happens. Never in a hundred years of me living as a different person.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">I grabbed my favorite long beige blazer and went to the exhibition at
                11 PM. I was supposed to go there at 9 PM but my sister suddenly came to my house and asked me
                to babysit her baby as she had dinner with her husband&rsquo;s colleague. That night was cold, I
                regret not wearing the red scarf that was hanging behind my room door. There weren&rsquo;t many
                people as I got there, the exhibition was held on the sixth floor of a ten-story building across
                from Sera&#39;s office. I would describe the whole exhibition as unique; the artist didn&rsquo;t
                display more than 10 paintings and most of them are painted in a black canvas. I went to see the
                paintings one by one until I reached what I consider as the winner among these paintings here.
                It was displayed right beside a window that was pointing straight at the empty sky. The painting
                feels familiar somehow, it was an abstract form of the view of a dark forest that was mostly
                surrounded by tall pine trees, the sky filled with light-yellow dots and one unique red object
                in the middle of it. I was so immersed that I didn&rsquo;t realize an Asian man with natural
                sparkling brown eyes that looked like they held the whole galaxy in it was approaching me. He
                was wearing a black turtleneck with mustard wide leg pants. His black frame glasses were hanging
                on his sharp nose. He was standing beside me in front of the window, his face was as bright as
                the sun but his eyes would remind you of the stars. He greets me with a smile that shows his
                canines. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;What do you think of this painting? I noticed you have been
                standing here for a quite long time,&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful, it somehow feels familiar to me,&rdquo; I
                replied while looking at the painting.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Familiar? How so?&rdquo; he asked again, now sounding more
                curious.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;ve been there before, well maybe I
                did,&rdquo; I said with a smile, then I realized that his face was all being serious about it.
                &ldquo;Oh, I mean it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve really been there before. It&rsquo;s just my
                memory that was playing tricks on me,&rdquo; I said. That was one of the dumbest things to say.
                Yeah, talking about memories to someone whom we just met is not weird at all. It&rsquo;s beyond
                that.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;Are you Arthur, the artist of these beautiful paintings?&rdquo;
                I asked, trying to change the topic. He nodded at me as the answer, now his face
                softened.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">I got distracted by the sky when I was about to look at the painting once
                again before going back home. I am now shifting my attention to the window beside the painting,
                and it made my body tremble just by seeing it. The red dot that once had lost its glow now
                appeared </span><span class="c2 c7">again </span><span class="c3 c2">in front of me, brighter
                than how I&#39;d seen it a hundred years ago. Without me realizing it, tears were running down
                my cheeks. I got lost in that red star view until a voice that was saying a familiar word pulled
                me back to my consciousness. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">&ldquo;I named this painting Betelgeuse. It refers to the red object
                in the middle of it. I think of it as the star that connects us to the people we care the most,
                no matter what circumstance that we are in,&rdquo; Arthur said to me while looking at the
                painting, he then looked at me with his beautiful smile after he finished his sentence.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3 c2">The word that only existed between me and someone very dearly to me in
                my first life came out of his mouth. It&rsquo;s him, the one that I have been waiting for. He is
                the half that my heart has been missing. He is the reason for every laugh and the tears that I
                shed throughout my six lives. I have been waiting for him like this red star that was waiting
                for 642.5 light years to finally reach the earth. Now he is here with a smile that I have been
                dying to see since my first life ended. Now we&rsquo;re here just like how it was in my first
                life, looking at each other under this red star. Now I have finally found him in my sixth life.
                I have found him, my Betelgeuse.</span></p>
