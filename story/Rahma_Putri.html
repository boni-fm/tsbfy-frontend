                A hectic day in a busy city, with a sea of people doing their business.
                Everything around me seems always cool tone color. The greyish sky was decorated with pale blue clouds
                pouring water anytime they want. People were busy walking with their black umbrellas, their heads low to the
                gray ground, the view of the pale blue skyscrapers that surrounded this little caf&eacute; where I worked as
                a part-time job between my classes at the college that I excitedly apply at that time. The white and greyish
                shelf is displaying the homemade bread and cake, then muted brown as the wallpaper combined with the wooden
                floor. One of the tables was placed near the big window, from where people could see the view of the city
                and the people walking by, and that&rsquo;s my favorite spot to enjoy the warm coffee as I waited for my
                shift, mostly spending my time thereby trying to finish some work, or sometimes just stared at the sky and
                thinking about which cheap ramen noodles to eat today as my dinner, my attempt to save some money. It was
                very different from the time when I was 15. It was sunshine and rainbows. I didn&rsquo;t have to be worried
                about food, clothes, and life. Until I realized that the reality that I have to face is not as exciting and
                free as what it is pictured by those actors who&rsquo;d wearing fancy and flashy outfits- which is something
                I couldn&rsquo;t afford at all now, in those movies on the TV screen. I was too optimistic, which ended up
                hurting my expectation. And no one tells me the truth, not even my mom.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mom, why do I have to wear this boring and ugly uniform all the time?! I want
                to wear something pretty and colorful too.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">There was a moment of silence before my mom laugh softly at my question.</span></p>
        <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh dear, of course, you can wear pretty clothes! That&rsquo;s why you have
                to study harder to be able to study at a good college.&rdquo; I look at her with eyes full of hope and nod
                my head. &ldquo;I promise, I will!&rdquo; I said without any doubt.</span></p>
        <p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">Na&iuml;ve. It&rsquo;s not just like what I imagined from the whole 3 years in
                high school. The thoughts of having the freedom of choosing what dress or skirt or anything I wanted to wear
                to the class- not the boring and ugly uniform. Having new friends with the new people who are excited to
                know about the story of my life, and eating lunch together with them in the cafeteria. The thoughts of
                having to visit the cool places, and museums just to get inspiration for the given project, or even having
                to search books for a specific class in the national library, taking some good pictures to post them on my
                social media accounts to remember those memories in a special place with people who I will call them as
                &lsquo;friends&rsquo;. I kept playing those fake but-at least makes me happy scenarios in my head over and
                over, like a broken DVD player. At that time, those were the only escape from the hellish reality in high
                school that I could do in my silly 17 years old, the freedom of college life was the only thing that kept me
                half alive. Meanwhile, half of me was already numb, just like on that day when I had my nose bleeding.
            </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh god, Nadine! Your nose is bleeding again! We should go to the
                school&rsquo;s clinic this time!&rdquo; &nbsp;She worriedly grabbed my right hand, strong enough to make my
                body stand up from my seat. But I yanked her hand away and stared angrily at her.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;NO! I CAN&rsquo;T LEAVE, NOT UNTIL I FINISH READING THIS BOOK, THANIA! JUST
                PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">After saying that, my body automatically sat down, glued to the old chair. I swapped
                away the blood with my sleeves until I think the blood stops coming out.</span></p>
        <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You! What a crazy witch. Fine, I&rsquo;ll go as you ask. But remember,
                you&rsquo;re gonna ruin your own life and go mental in the future.&rdquo; She said firmly before tidying up
                her things and moving to another seat in the back row, far from me. I could feel her cold stare stabbing my
                back. I lost the only person I have at that time. </span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">Thania was right, she always and has been right. I&rsquo;m the one who stacked my
                life with a bunch of false hopes that lied to me. I have to accept a lie after living for 19 years of life
                in this ruthless world. I realized that I hurt myself even more because of my expectations. Even though, not
                all of them were lies. Where I did use the freedom to dress up, I met a lot of new people with diverse
                backgrounds and personalities and went to the museums. But I couldn&rsquo;t feel the happiness that I have
                been dreamt of. All of those slowly turned into something even more burdensome, for me. The fear of people
                judging me is haunted my mind. I even talked to. Meanwhile, the rest of them were most likely only talking
                when they have something really necessary to talk about. I had no one to talk to about life. But
                that&rsquo;s not their fault, it&rsquo;s me. &ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m the problem.&rdquo; it was my last
                word before falling further into the cold and dark pit, alone. I came to the point when living was too
                tiring, but dying was too scary. </span></p>
        <p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">When most college students searched for a part-time job, I&rsquo;m the opposite.
                All I want to do was to focus on my study and be able to finish college and find a job with a great salary.
                I know, it sounds monotone. I just wanna have a normal life, just like what my mom said. But once again, it
                seems like God has another plan. In just a blink of my eyes, the hospital and white room with the smell of
                medicine, and the sound of the medical devices that support the patient life, have become a very familiar
                view, aside from my bedroom and the classroom. The patient in that room is my father. The situation become
                even more serious when the nurse announced that my father was suffering from a rare condition, he need
                numerous bags of blood to save his life. That&rsquo;s it. </span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nadine, I have to tell you something&hellip;I know you must be still in shock,
                aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Her voice sounds painful and hoarse, like someone that has been crying for hours but
                still trying to comfort me when she isn&rsquo;t in any better condition. </span></p>
        <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Your father&hellip; needs bags of blood and further examination about his
                condition. All of them cost us more than our life budget, sweetheart&hellip;&rdquo; That&rsquo;s all I
                heard, before the rest of her words just turn into a sound of static. </span></p>
        <p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">Lonely. Tired. Painful. There wasn&rsquo;t any option left, except to be a
                part-timer in this little caf&eacute;- another safe place beside my bed, in the middle of the city. In this
                place, no one talks to each other. People are busy with their businesses. The conversation with everyone
                that I ever had never lasted long, usually only a simple good afternoon or how&rsquo;s your day, or a casual
                question about the order, and that&rsquo;s all. Not until I met him, a very tall guy, with tan skin which
                made him look even more stand out in the sea of people. His dark-brown hair looks extremely soft as the wind
                blows them away. When he smiles, you can see a pair of a tooth that looks like a fang, making him look
                unreal. He looks like a dream. I didn&rsquo;t aware of his presence until the day he talk to me during my
                shift. The day when everything is changed. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello, how was your day, sir? And what do you want to order?&rdquo; I said
                while slowly raising my head, ready to greet the person in front of me. And that&rsquo;s when my eyes met
                his eyes. The eyes are full of warmth and hope. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">We just stand there, feeling like we&rsquo;d been cast by medusa and turned into
                statues, we stared at each other. &ldquo;Uhm&hellip;excuse me, sir?&rdquo; trying to break the awkward
                silence.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ah- I&rsquo;m sorry, I want a cup of black coffee and one slice of cheesecake,
                please.&rdquo; He shyly scratched the nape of his neck.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, sir.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help to smile as well just by
                looking at him. &ldquo;Do you want to eat here or make it as a take-out?&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1">He paused for a while, before replying. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll start enjoying
                them in here from today.&rdquo; He said as he put one hand on the counter table and smiled gently at
                me.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">I learned his name from that day, Matthew. It was the longest conversation I ever
                had; when we talked it feels like the world stop moving. It sounds clich&eacute;, but it&rsquo;s the truth!
                I can&rsquo;t help to steal some glances at him from the back of the counter as I&rsquo;m serving other
                people. I was mesmerized, but never had any thought that our interaction from that day could turn into
                something more than a customer and waitress. And he keeps his promise, the promise to always eat or simply
                drink his black coffee in here, only at my shift. I don&rsquo;t know why, but it feels like the burdens on
                my shoulders are slightly gone as we constantly met. I think it&rsquo;s not the Medusa who cast the spell on
                me, but Matthew. </span></p>
        <p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">I learned a lot about him as we talk in the middle of his order. He&rsquo;s 3
                years older than me. Matthew isn&rsquo;t not originally from here, he had to move here because his work
                required him to do it, and there might be a chance that he&rsquo;ll get transferred to another city- which I
                hope he didn&rsquo;t have to. Until one day he didn&rsquo;t come. I thought maybe he was busy that day, so
                he couldn&rsquo;t come or he already found another caf&eacute; with better a menu. But I&rsquo;ve always
                waited for him, hoping for him to come, even only for a second. Then, it&rsquo;s been 5 days since the last
                day he come. I tried to brush away my hopes, didn&rsquo;t want to get another false hope. But this time it
                seems God feels pity for me. He answers my prayer because Matthew is here! He brings a bucket of pink roses.
                This makes me feel kinda envious of whoever will get those roses. But what can I do? I&rsquo;m just somebody
                for him, right? So, I calmed myself, tried to act normal, and greet him. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hi! It&rsquo;s been a long time since I see you come here. Is everything
                alright?&rdquo; My mouth just slips away, which makes me sound like I&rsquo;m here only to see him.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">He looked shocked but happy as he replied to me with a smile. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hello! I was busy these days, I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t visit&hellip;I
                miss you though&rdquo; His eyes shoot open after realizing what he just said, but quickly added, &ldquo;I
                mean I miss your coffee!&rdquo;I was shocked, then I can feel butterflies start flying around in my
                belly.</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Uh&hellip;It&rsquo;s okay, you don&rsquo;t have to apologize to me,
                I-I&rsquo;m just glad that you&rsquo;re okay.&rdquo; as my mouth struggle to make a clear sentence.
                &ldquo;So, are you gonna order the usual?&rdquo; I tried to hide my nerve by pretending to use the tablet
                menu. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes, and can I talk to you after your shift, Nadine?&rdquo; He replied
                immediately. &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, a cup of black coffee and a slice of cheesecake will come to your
                table, sir,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Oh, sure! But my shift end pretty late, is that okay?&rdquo; </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2 c6"><span class="c1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay. I can wait anytime for you.&rdquo; then he walked
                away.</span></p>
        <p class="c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I flipped the open sign into the
                close. We talked, and he asked me. No, he&rsquo;s not asking me to date him, he asks me if I already had my
                dinner or not. If not, he wished to have me come over to his place and have dinner with him as he offers the
                bucket of pink roses to me. Matthew said that this is the only way to say thank you to me, simply because I
                made his days better just by seeing my smile while serving other people. &ldquo;You look like an angel when
                you smile at people- someone you didn&rsquo;t know. The smile that could save someone &lsquo;s life without
                you realizing.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t believe him at first, but when I see his red face and the seriousness
                in his eyes, I can&rsquo;t refuse. I wasn&rsquo;t regretting my decision. His place is very neat, simple,
                and warm. </span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">From that day Matthew and I started hanging out after my shift ends, he&rsquo;ll come
                over and wait patiently. He&rsquo;s always there, beside me. Even when one day I got a call from my mom
                telling me that my father&rsquo;s condition became worsened, he was there. Give me a ride to the hospital
                and still tried to comfort me while driving his car. He&rsquo;s always been a gentleman. Watching all of the
                things that happened to me. Unconsciously, Matthew has become a part of my life. The most exciting part of
                my life is spending my time with him, feels like part of my worries are gone. We go everywhere we can in his
                car from the park, river, beach or any restaurant we see to buy some food before going back to his place and
                eating them together. Giving the food reviews and stars, like what the judges do in those cooking
                competitions. Childish, but I love it. I love him. He often has to teach me how to play a game on his
                console, only for me to beg defeated by him in a second. We always love to have small chats before sleep
                about anything. One time, we exchange stories about our life. Matthew&rsquo;s life is just perfect, born
                into a pretty wealthy family. Nothing really worried him. When it was my turn to tell my stories, he
                couldn&rsquo;t say anything but just hug me tightly in the end, as he said, &ldquo;How painful must it have
                been&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry, Nadine&hellip;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; he said as if it were his fault. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c1">As his place has become my second home, our relationship didn&rsquo;t have specific c
                status. Sometimes we are a lover, friends, or enemies, we can be anything we need. Talking about bedtime,
                Matthew gives his bed to me and he would likely sleep on the sofa in the living room. &ldquo;I just
                didn&rsquo;t like sleeping with the pillow, they hurt my neck!&rdquo; his excuse every time I ask him to
                switch places with me. Not until one night, he&rsquo;s his acting was different than the usual. I could see
                his sad face between his smile. I kept asking him, wanting to know about his day. But he just replied with a
                question and promise. &ldquo;Can I sleep in bed with you only for tonight, Nadine? I promise I&rsquo;m not
                gonna do anything weird to you.&rdquo; He replied with a smile. I know that he was faking his smile.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know he has been hiding something
                from me. But I didn&rsquo;t have any courage to ask him, didn&rsquo;t want to know the bad news. I
                didn&rsquo;t want to lose him. That night, was the first time we slept together in his bed. T</span><span
                class="c1 c13">he way Matthew looked that night, his eyes closed heavy, hair soft after I had to blow-dry it
                for him. In his sleep, he was constantly trying to tuck his warm&nbsp;arms between my smaller body, bring me
                closer to him, which always ran hot, his body always radiating a comfortable warmth. He tried to get away
                with it by giving one of his gentle smiles, which always makes my heart clench with an onslaught of
                overwhelming fondness and emotions. That was the last moment of him before he was completely gone from my
                sight. Leaving me with an empty and cold bed, and a note, saying how happy and grateful he was for having a
                chance to spend his precious time with me. How I inspired him to be strong, hoping he can stay forever
                beside me, seeing my face in the morning beside him. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c9 c8">Nadine. I&rsquo;m sorry for leaving you so suddenly. I was trying to tell you
                about my I&rsquo;m not ready to say goodbye. I wish I&rsquo;m brave enough just like you, angel. You deserve
                someone who will do everything to keep you happy, and I wish I can be that someone. And if you see this
                note, I hope you know that I&rsquo;ll miss you, I will. Let&rsquo;s meet in another series of twenties,
                okay? See you. </span></p>

        <p class="c2 c10"><span class="c1">It was the rainy season and I was in my 21 when I met him for the first time and
                summer comes in when left. He, a stranger who entirely changed how I live my life, has turned into someone I
                love that changed the way I see the world. Now, I can face the world sincerely. As someone who never
                expected anything special would happen in my life, his presence is truly a gift. My life has been filled
                with a sequence of unlucky things, which makes me didn&rsquo;t realize that there were a lot of little
                things that could make me happy. Not until I met him in the lowest state of my life when the whole world
                seemed so dark. So, Matthew Koch, thank you so much for finding me. You&rsquo;ll be always in my remembrance
                and I hope there&rsquo;s a little part of your memories about me too. Let&rsquo;s meet at 25? 26? I&rsquo;ll
                wait. </span></p>
