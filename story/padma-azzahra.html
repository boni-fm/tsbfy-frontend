                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">The rain was unable to stop on that day in December. People
                                    hated the sudden and
                                    heavy rain since they were occupying themselves in order to avoid getting drenched.
                                    Her entire life she had
                                    always adored the rain dearly. Indeed, the rain is possibly falling every day, but
                                    is it wrong if someone
                                    loves the rain? </span><span class="c2 c4">Is it wrong to fall in love with
                                    someone?</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was trying to get drenched by swaying and dancing under
                                    the rain. Not long ago,
                                    there was a tall man in a black coat covering his formal attire, approaching
                                    her.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">I am more afraid if you
                                    getting cold afterward, then I
                                    might have to take care of you, my love,&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">said the man
                                    under the
                                    umbrella,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Then, let it be. I was waiting
                                    for this in my dearest
                                    life after long summer, young man</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; she chuckled
                                    knowing her man was worried
                                    about her,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Are you perhaps so grateful
                                    about the rain or my
                                    proposal, young lady?</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Perhaps, maybe</span><span
                                    class="c0">&rdquo; she
                                    teased,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Then, he allowed his woman to celebrate their special day, a
                                    special day that she
                                    accepted his permission to step ahead in their relationship. He smiled ear-to-ear
                                    because of her answers
                                    most of the time that only God knew when he was able to know how to stop smiling.
                                    People might think he was
                                    a mad yet foolish man, </span><span class="c2">yes, he was madly in love with
                                    her.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">I think it&rsquo;s enough for
                                    your little dance since
                                    you have caught attention from everyone around here. Also, I assure you will get
                                    sick</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; he warned by pulling her waist,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">But now you get
                                    wet</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; he
                                    teased her,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">(giggle) &ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c4">Okay, okay, my
                                    Dear. I obey your order
                                    only for this time. Are you willing to compensate for ruining my little euphoria
                                    here?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Well, I do. Let&rsquo;s get
                                    you home
                                    first.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man covered her soaked clothes with her dark-long coat
                                    that he prepared in his
                                    car. They walked out of the street and playfully told how foolish they were on this
                                    day. Holding hands like
                                    their life depended on it and kept walking towards the man&rsquo;s car. He firstly
                                    prioritised his woman by
                                    opening the passenger seat door in terms of getting in the car first, followed by
                                    him and starting his car.
                                    The whole ride was calm and steady along with playing the woman&rsquo;s favourite
                                    playlist.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">I will never be bored of this
                                    song because it reminds
                                    me when we first met</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; she said,</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2 c4">I doubt that since I
                                    didn&rsquo;t hear the same
                                    song with you. At that time, I was captivated at your beauty&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Geez&hellip; that is the
                                    cheesiest thing that
                                    I&rsquo;ve ever heard</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">I was just teasing! Seriously,
                                    I didn&#39;t even know
                                    that before you told me in our first year. You were only busy with your errands,
                                    listening to the song and
                                    writing something</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">The man focused back on his track. Later on, the rain had
                                    just stopped and helped his
                                    vision to see clearly on the road. By that time their first destination was already
                                    near, and he had to stop
                                    his car in front of her house. His plan was not finished, she got more surprised
                                    with a painting of her that
                                    he made himself. A beautiful painting with dried daisies as her gown dress. The
                                    painting was on behalf of
                                    his compensation while he already intended for the longest time. </span><span
                                    class="c2">As well she was
                                    soon to become a lovely bride for him.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The woman kissed
                                    his hand and left his
                                    car, then waved her hand in signalling goodbye to him. He answered her goodbye and
                                    continued his driving to
                                    reach his final track.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Along the way to his own house, he mesmerised by the memories
                                    that he had experienced
                                    with her, the person that he dearly cherished. She might not be his first love but
                                    somehow, she was able to
                                    create everything as his first. For almost six years being in a relationship with
                                    her was the ethereal thing
                                    that he had had. She loved the rain as well as she was the rain to the arid of
                                    himself. It was enough to
                                    convince him that she was the only one by proposing to her on Christmas Day under
                                    the mistletoe. Since he
                                    secretly read all of her wishlists through her journal. She was everything that he
                                    has been seeking for,
                                </span><span class="c2">he thought</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Day to day, night to night, as the roses began to bloom. It
                                    seems that the roses were
                                    extremely acknowledged in which time to grow. The sun gently gave a great morning to
                                    the folks who began
                                    their own errands. A piece of music played along in her bedroom while she
                                    concentrated on styling her hair
                                    and wearing a Florence waterfall dress in sage green satin. </span><span
                                    class="c2">Oh, she desperately
                                    wished that her man would have known that she had cried a lot over a letter that she
                                    already regretted
                                    opening and their trivial argument last night. </span><span class="c0">People might
                                    be saying it was a trial
                                    for the soon-to-be wedded couple. Nevertheless, they tried to communicate with each
                                    other in order to
                                    prevent something bad happening to them. A sudden bell rang from the outside that
                                    was interrupting her
                                    little thoughts, indicating her man had just arrived.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">How do I look? Is it too much
                                    or too
                                    basic?</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">You still look gorgeous either
                                    way. How&rsquo;s the

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">&ldquo;</span><span class="c2">Almost. I would like to check

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">She smiled with full force to convince her man that she was
                                    alright. A soft yet quick
                                    peck from her fianc&eacute; and softly whispering &ldquo;</span><span

                                    heaven up there of the
                                    thoughts that slipped in his fianc&eacute;e&rsquo;s mind, according to him. The man
                                    implied to go down from
                                    her house and drove away to the house which would belong to them.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tree leaves abruptly fell down all around the pedestrian
                                    street. The fallen
                                    leaves hindered the drivers&rsquo; views as it fell on the windshield. A car parked
                                    in front of an old
                                    house. Quite damaged and a little bit abandoned since there were barely any tenants
                                    that had stayed in the
                                    past. Seeing from the roof, it looked like it would fall at any time. On the other
                                    side, each side of the
                                    walls still strongly stood to hold the things they left. Suddenly, the man and woman
                                    were warmly greeted by
                                    an old lady who wore a comfortable shirt and a black floral-patterned skirt. It was
                                    the landlady of the
                                    house who allowed them to get in the house.</span></p>

                                    came out from their mouth to break the silence between her and him. The woman only
                                    turned her head to look
                                    at the road as they were on the way to the place where his cousin married. It was a
                                    habit for him to open
                                    the passenger seat door and gently request her soft hand. They met many relatives
                                    and friends of the man. It
                                    was a slight reunion for them, especially since they introduced themselves as

                                    fianc&eacute;e this time. In a moment, the bride was smiling brightly and holding

                                    everyone in the hall was waiting for this little tradition. The bride had tossed her
                                    bouquet which
                                    surprisingly was caught by the man. </span><span class="c2">The unexpected moment he

                                    that they caught the
                                    bouquet together following the cheers and clapping sounds from everyone for that

                                    filled the hall which
                                    delighted those who danced with their lovers. His eyes dilated as he looked at her
                                    brown eyes, suddenly he
                                    pulled her closer taking the lead by holding her waist tightly. She eased her weight
                                    so she could dance
                                    comfortably. The way their forehead leaned on each other and closed their eyes in

                                    trembling and her mouth slightly parted as she was about to utter some words. His
                                    eyes first filled with
                                    hope and happiness, now immediately filled with confusion and lost. Nonetheless,

                                    out of her mouth, then she abruptly left him dumbfounded. She excused herself from
                                    the dance party. The man
                                    swiftly followed her rushing steps and tried to shout her name and block her step at

                                    was unable to think of
                                    what happened to him. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">The clock was ticking and the hand-kept running as life was

                                    months after the incident, there were no messages, calls, or even mails from her.
                                    People might be thinking
                                    that he was far from being a gentleman while he was trying to put himself first. On

                                    darkness and loneliness surrounded and ate all of herself since her tears flowed
                                    down endlessly.
                                </span><span class="c2">This is so much worse; this was far as they wanted</span><span
                                    class="c0">. She decided
                                    to get up her body forcefully and wrote a letter to him. Contemplating what kind of
                                    words she needed to
                                    explain what had happened to her and him. She walked down and went to his house, yet
                                    she acknowledged that
                                    she had no rights to meet him this soon. Sensing a heightened adrenaline rush into
                                    her blood, she put her
                                    letter in front of his house. Before she met him, she ran away as far as she could
                                    do her best. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c3">In the evening, the man came home from work and found a
                                    letter written by his lover.
                                </span><span class="c2">Meet me at 8 in the place where we first became engaged.
                                </span><span class="c0">He
                                    wondered where it was, was it the place when they first met? Was it the place when
                                    they first dated? What
                                    did she mean they got engaged? He had no time to figure out the place since his
                                    clock showed 6 p.m. which
                                    meant that he had to rush. Assuming the meaning of engaged, he assures that it was
                                    the place where he
                                    proposed to her. She cherished the dusk of the sun because she thought that the sun
                                    was saying goodbye and
                                    promising to be back soon. For this reason, he enlightened himself to believe that
                                    he was right. Indeed, he
                                    knew all too well everything about her. He found her as she also was waiting for his
                                    presence. The luminance

                                    fast. She found him too
                                    after a while of waiting and hoping he would come. He began taking several steps to
