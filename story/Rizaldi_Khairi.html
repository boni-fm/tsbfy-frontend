            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">TOMORROW MY SISTER will visit me. She visits me once a week to check my health
                    conditions. She is a fresh graduate from medical school out of town. Due to what she said, I have a weak
                    heart and memory loss because of my childhood trauma. Apparently our mother&#39;s death was the reason for
                    my trauma, according to my sister. I do not remember any of it. She also said that she did not know how our
                    mother died. All she knew is that our mother was killed by someone.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since today is a special occasion for
                    us, my sister is going to spend more time than she usually does. October 3rd was the day our mother left us
                    behind with no guidance. Of course, I have no memory of it. My sister is coming late to the grave. She said
                    she had to go to the supermarket first. I can see her across the street coming in my direction. I look at my
                    watch, thirty minutes late. I am curious what made her late to visit our mother&rsquo;s grave.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where have you been? The supermarket is only five minutes walk from our
                    house.&rdquo; I ask her with a high tone, almost angry and disappointed. &ldquo;Sorry, I had to buy flowers
                    for mom.&rdquo; She gives me a reasonable answer.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c10 c3">We drive to our home together when she plays classical music on the road. She
                    said it makes her calm. Suddenly I remember that we used to hear classical music when we were young. We are
                    not saying even a word in the car. She focuses on the road and listening to the music, and I open up my
                    phone and watch some stuff on </span><span class="c3 c9">Youtube.</span><span class="c5 c3">&nbsp;Suddenly
                    she starts breaking the silence between us after the music stops.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c3">&ldquo;Do you still have the pills I prescribed you?&rdquo; She asks me with a
                    lower voice.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c3">&ldquo;Yeah, I think. Why?&rdquo; I answer with hesitation, knowing that I
                    don&rsquo;t even know if there is any pill left.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c5">&ldquo;Call me if you need more, and do not let the bottle empty without telling
                    me. Okay, Karl?&quot;</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c3">&ldquo;Okay. By the way, how long are you going to stay?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c3">&ldquo;Uh, I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe three days. I need to settle things here for
                    mom.&rdquo; </span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c3">&ldquo;What things?&rdquo; I asked curiously.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c3">&ldquo;You know, it&#39;s adult matters. I&rsquo;ll tell you once it&#39;s done.
                    What do you want to eat for tomorrow?&rdquo; She tried to change the topic of the conversation.</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c5 c3">&ldquo;I wanna eat chicken.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c10">&ldquo;Alright, chicken it is.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After such a long journey from my mother&rsquo;s grave, I come back home with so
                    little energy to take a bath and clean up ourselves. I don&rsquo;t know about my sister, but once I am in my
                    bed, my head feels dizzy. I hear the sound of a car machine outside my house. It must be my sister who is
                    going outside. She must be buying the chicken that I want.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Three A.M in the morning, I wake up from my sleep. The dizziness in my head has
                    gotten much worse. I try to find the pills that my sister gets me. I look into the cabinet where I stash the
                    medication that I have. It seems that I cannot find it. I start to remember where the last time I put the
                    bottle of those pills was. A glimpse came into my mind. Apparently the sink in the bathroom is the last
                    place where I put the bottle. Luckily, I find the bottle, but as I see the bottle more carefully, I realize
                    that the pills in the bottle are already empty. I feel dizzy again, and now it makes my head spin. I try to
                    look at the mirror in front of me to get hold of myself. </span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once I see my reflection in the mirror, the dizziness slowly leaves my body but the
                    spinning still there. I talk to myself in the mirror and say that I will be alright. When I look into my
                    eyes in the mirror, I notice that my reflection is smiling. I am pretty sure that I did not smile at the
                    time. That phenomenon shocked me. I jump back, but when I blink, the reflection turns back to normal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; I ask myself about what just happened in front of my
                    eyes. But I don&rsquo;t want to make it into my overthinking. I assume maybe it&#39;s just a hallucination
                    that my brain made for the effect of the headache. Noticing that the headache is gone, then I proceed to go
                    back to sleep.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I wake up, I go down the stairs and try to find food in the kitchen. But I found
                    nothing. Then I remember that my sister left the house in the middle of the night. I wonder if she is home
                    yet. I hear the sound of the stairs start to crack as I walk it over. Then I am already in front of her
                    door. I start shouting her name, but there is no reply. I am about to open the door and hear the sound of a
                    car matching coming from outside. I look down the window to check who is coming. It was my sister. I come
                    down the stairs again.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Where were you last night?&rdquo; A question </span><span
                    class="c3">come</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from my mouth as soon as the door opened.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jeez, you startled me. My friend said she left her belongings in my apartment,
                    so I need to get back there to open the door.&rdquo; She answers me while having both hands ready to protect
                    herself, just like the boxing defense position.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry if I startle you. I don&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; I replied while lowering
                    my voice.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you okay? Your face looks pale?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I looked at her face. She looked worried about my condition.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I just couldn&#39;t sleep properly last night.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rest properly, Karl. You know you have a weak heart.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know, I know... Do you bring the chicken that we talked about
                    yesterday?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, I forgot about it. Why don&rsquo;t you go to Mr. Gu&rsquo;s store and buy
                    chicken there?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aaaaahhhh, alright, alright. I am going to go there. But let me borrow your
                    car.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;hmmm.. But only this time.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, I grab my jacket and the money for the chicken. While on the road I keep
                    wondering, is there something off about her today. Then I remember, she never let me borrow her car before.
                    Why today she let me borrow her car today? I am trying to be positive about it and just assume that she was
                    feeling sorry that she did not bring the chicken.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I arrive at Mr. Gu&rsquo;s store and
                    act fast to buy a chicken. I am about to leave when Mr. Gu stops and tells me,</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I saw your&rsquo; sister cryin&rsquo; on the park last night.&rdquo; The
                    information he gave me contradicts what my sister told me this morning.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it Mr. Gu? Are you sure that you are not seeing another person?&rdquo; I
                    asked to confirm the information that Mr. Gu gave me.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I know it was dark at the time. But I know it is yer&rsquo;
                    sister&rsquo;s car that parked there.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, thank you, Mr. Gu, for the information. I am going to leave
                    now.&rdquo; This makes my head hurt again. I don&rsquo;t know what the truth is.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is getting dark, and the wind
                    starts to blow. I get into the car and play music. The car radio in her car is broken, so it is just a music
                    player. I </span><span class="c3">look</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;into a playlist in her car, and I
                    realize that she only listens to classical music. It&#39;s just... I cannot enjoy it because I cannot sing
                    along to the song. But there is no choice, so I play the only music in the car to accompany me on my way
                    back home.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I get home, I deliver the
                    chicken to my sister in the kitchen. She immediately starts to cut the chicken into some parts. I see her
                    doing that, and I go to the bathroom in my room. My head still hurts because of the information that Mr. Gu
                    gave me. I start to look for my medicine, but I remember it is empty. The headache is getting worse. I
                    cannot scream my sister&rsquo;s name to ask for help. But I still can whisper. Right now, I believe that
                    this is just my hallucination because the man I saw in the mirror is not me anymore. His movement and his
                    body language are very different from mine. His expression is also different from my expression right
                    now.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who...are...you?&rdquo; I barely can talk</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? You may not know me, but I know every little thing about you. I even know
                    a memory that you don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; He talks very slowly, like he is playing with me.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? You... know... what... happened... on... the... day... my... mother...
                    died?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, do you know why? Because I was there when your mother died.&rdquo; He
                    laughs. His laughing is terrifying.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? You... are... me... right. So... it... means...&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;HA HA HA, you finally understand. Stop consuming the pills that your sister
                    gave you, and your memory will slowly come back. The truth will be brought to the light.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty minutes later, I wake up
                    because I heard my sister&rsquo;s voice. She asks me to go downstairs to help her with the meal. I look at
                    my face in the mirror, and I do not see him at the moment. Rather, I see myself being pretty messed up
                    because I was unconscious for thirty minutes. My eyes feel so heavy, my head is not hurt anymore, and my
                    chest is getting warm as my heart is beating. </span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Karl, come downstairs and help me serve the meal.&rdquo; She screamed from
                    downstairs, knowing that I did not answer her first call.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll be there soon,&rdquo; I answer her call, trying not to make
                    her upset.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I washed my face and prepared myself
                    to be as fresh as possible. But in the end, my eyes still feel heavy. As I walk down the stairs, the memory
                    that I lost slowly begins to come back. One by one, the memory of the day of my mother&rsquo;s death is
                    coming into the light. The sound of the rain, along with the thunder, makes the mood in the house more
                    gloomy. But it is lightened with the sound of classical music that my sister plays in the kitchen.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;I am here. What do you need me for?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Help me prepare the plate and the drinks.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I am not replying to her words like I used to and just do what she asks me to
                    do.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can I ask you a question, Sis?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, what is it?&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The pills that you gave me, what is it for?&rdquo; I look into her eyes, and
                    she looks worried.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why did you ask that question? Of course, it is for your heart
                    issue.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie, right? You know, when I did not take the pills, my heart
                    was still fine. It&#39;s not like I have a weak heart. But rather, when &nbsp;I did not take the pills, it
                    only gave me a headache.&rdquo; I talk with a little bit of anger because of a lie she said.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Karl?! Are the pills empty? What did I say about telling me when it&#39;s
                    about to get empty?&rdquo; She sounds angry, and the look in her eyes, I don&rsquo;t know what expression
                    that is.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was about to tell you, but I forgot, and the man in the mirror told me not
                    to.&rdquo;</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Karl, my brother. It is not true. It&#39;s just your imagination. Don&rsquo;t
                    listen to that thing you see.&rdquo; She tries to calm me down.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I do not reply to her words. My hands moved on their own to the direction where the
                    knife was.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Karl, please. Do not repeat what you did to your mother ten years ago. Please,
                    Karl, I am begging you,&rdquo; she asks me with tears along her face.</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">&ldquo;So you know what I did to our mother? WHY DON&rsquo;T YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH? I
                    WAS LIVING MY WHOLE LIFE NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW!! WHEN I DID NOT TAKE YOUR PILLS, THE TRUTH
                    IS NOW UNCOVERED.&rdquo; I </span><span class="c3">become</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;furious about the
                    fact that she </span><span class="c3">hide</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the truth from me.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am sorry, Karl. Mother asked me not to tell you the truth before she died. I
                    was there too when you killed her.&rdquo; She is crying for her life.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I hear that, I become more
                    furious. I do the same thing that happened to my mother. The sound of thunderous rain combined with
                    classical music make a perfect day for me to repeat what I did ten years ago. It is exactly the same as what
                    happened ten years ago, a thunderous rain, my mother playing her favorite classical music. I believed that
                    she lied to me at the time, that was why I killed her.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I understand why my sister acted like that to me after mother&rsquo;s death.
                    Never smile in front of me and the worried eyes. I know the reason. She is afraid of me. And her fear now
                    became reality that put her down to sleep forever. I am starting to be afraid of myself. I left alone in
                    this old house, leaving me no choice but to kill myself too, after calling the police.</span></p>
