                                    South. His father said he
                                    would one day become the King, succeeding his father, King Namor. As the only heir,
                                    he knows the succession
                                    where he rose to become King is still years away. He pleads to his father, where he
                                    goes on a journey to
                                    prove himself to be worthy. </span></p>

                                    steps down. He will still take place in the Kingdom, where he still oversees the
                                    Kingdom until Gemini is
                                    ready to make his own decision. Like much of his stubbornness, Gemini says he will
                                    take on the journey for
                                    at least three years to prove himself worthy of holding the title King.</span></p>

                                    calm for the party as they recuperate after the battle in the cave. They barely came
                                    out alive. Ravus, the
                                    party leader, is honing his bloody sword. Josselyn, as a Warlock, is resting herself
                                    after lending too much
                                    power on behalf of her fire spirit. Julian is listening to the story of Gemini.
                                    Ophiucus, as a bird
                                    humanoid, tends to his broken wings.</span></p>

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To be honest, I was stubborn about it. My father said,

                                    but I am not ready. It was a long way, to be sure, but this could be my last year on

                                    says Gemini. &ldquo;One thing that happened in this journey was this healing power I
                                    have. I must thank
                                    Apollo.&rdquo;</span></p>

                                    created. From the
                                    distance of the moon above their head signified it just barely past midnight. The
                                    situation of the party is
                                    not great. All of them are wounded to some degree, from broken wings to bleeding.
                                    Gemini is helping as much
                                    as he can with his power to prevent further injuries. They need to come to the
                                    nearest church or temple for
                                    proper treatment.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>

                                    here,&rdquo; says Gemini.
                                    &ldquo;Scouting the area shouldn&rsquo;t be this long with many people joining
                                    him.&rdquo;</span></p>

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gemini looks at the party once again and sees they are now in
                                    a better state.
                                    &ldquo;If he is still taking a long time, I will be down by the river. Tell me if we
                                    are ready to

                                    after a short walk to
                                    the small river flow. As Gemini looks down, moonlight shines on the river revealing
                                    his own reflection. His
                                    red hair is messy, and his face is covered with blue bruises darker than his bluish
                                    skin tones. The one that
                                    is fine from the battle is his ear fins, a feature of Tritons, people of the
                                    Sea.</span></p>

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gemini sits and reaches out his hand into the flowing water.
                                    The power he always
                                    held, and he is certain was given by the waves, is to communicate with his people
                                    through the flowing water.
                                    As long as the water flows to the sea, he can speak through it or sees his own
                                    memory.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gemini&rsquo;s eyes are hollow, knowing the effort to

                                    to his home is futile. It&rsquo;s been almost half a year since the communication
                                    was not going through. The
                                    only thing he is able to see is his own memory. The memories he can see are from the
                                    core memory he always
                                    holds dearly to him.</span></p>

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Gemini looks at the kingdom he lived in for one last time. It
                                    was his idea to embark
                                    on a journey, and he is now ready to leave. He already accepts not being able to see
                                    his parents or even
                                    home for how long? He doesn&rsquo;t know neither.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before him, he sees his mother standing at the front gate. It
                                    is unusual for his
                                    mother, as a Queen, to steps outside the kingdom. Gemini steps forward to approach
                                    her. He can see a
                                    necklace with a half-crowned pendant in his mother&#39;s hand.</span></p>

                                    through to his family

                                    the sea. Gemini took a
                                    deep breath and closed his eyes. There is no way he moved into the sea by dipping
                                    his hand into the river.
                                    He opens his eyes. The vision of a forest is completely gone, replaced by the vision
                                    of rubbles and corals,
                                    the underwater.</span></p>

                                    at the end of his

                                    markets are all gone.
                                    Gemini can&rsquo;t believe his eyes. It&rsquo;s not a pleasant view to see. It might
                                    be real or not since
                                    someone pulled him here.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The place is already overrun by minions. They look like
                                    half-human and half-fish.
                                    Whatever they are guarding must be important. Could someone that is commanding the
                                    destruction of this
                                    place? In his life, Gemini doesn&rsquo;t know if his father has many enemies, nor
                                    does he know his allies.
                                    His father never let Gemini accompany him in political meetings with people
                                    throughout the sea.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Avoiding remnants of buildings is hard. Make a wrong step,
                                    and it will alert at least
                                    anyone nearby. It&rsquo;s not helping Gemini a favour. He&rsquo;s also wearing metal
                                    armors. He takes his
                                    steps through the path where it was emptier, through the back of the market east,
                                    where it has a shortest
                                    way to the castle.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gemini&rsquo;s is at a loss with the situation of the market
                                    now. Nothing is left
                                    there. Only remains of once trade activity in the kingdom. There&rsquo;s nothing
                                    much he can do while
                                    affected by Waves magic. What he can do now is only to find the source of the person
                                    who pulled him
                                    there.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0">&mdash;</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">After walked through the path, Gemini is now in front of the
                                    castle gate. No minions
                                    nearby guarding the gate. With no hesitation, he enters the gate. Gemini is now in
                                    the field leading to the
                                    castle. No signs of life anywhere still, but the damage of the castle is
                                    severe.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gemini slowly walked the path. Rubbles of broken statues are
                                    all over the path,
                                    making it look like a ruin. Place where Gemini once lived and grew up is now
                                    miserable. Once stood strong it
                                    now only rubbles, a shadow of its former glory. Gemini stops for a moment to look at
                                    the castle. It is sad
                                    to look at it. </span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&quot;I wonder if I didn&rsquo;t leave, will it still be
                                    here? Is it my fault not
                                    protecting this place?&quot; He has gone for so long and not knowing dangers as he
                                    is too far from
                                    home.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">While looking at the castle, Gemini heard a movement in the
                                    rubbles. He looks around,
                                    and no one is there. He then moves his gaze back on the castle and notices a figure
                                    standing in front of it
                                    now. The figure has a sword sheathed in his hip and shield strapped in the back.
                                    Gemini readies his shield,
                                    bracing for an attack. The figure stood there, not moving an inch. It is directly
                                    looking at Gemini.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?!&rdquo; Gemini shouts, but he gets no
                                    answer. &ldquo;If you are
                                    the one who dragged me here, identify yourself!&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">In the speed of a blink, the figure leaps forward and charges
                                    at Gemini with his
                                    sword. The slash of the sword is slower than their speed. It is dealing a blow to
                                    Gemini&rsquo;s shield,
                                    forcing him aback.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Heh, surprised you can block my attack,&rdquo; says
                                    the figure.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gemini pants, the strength of the swing definitely caught him
                                    off-guard. If he did
                                    not ready to block back, he would have been injured.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Our fight is not now. I merely want to
                                    talk.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t buy it! Identify yourself!&rdquo; Gemini
                                    shouted.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Got the spirit of your father, huh. You are truly the
                                    Crown Prince of this

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Gemini readies his shield again in case of the following
                                    attack. The figure then
                                    walks to Gemini and lowers his shield. Assuring there is no more attack.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>

                                    then points the sword to Gemini&rsquo;s pendant. In reflex, Gemini stands back and
                                    clutches the pendant of
                                    the necklace.</span></p>

                                    Our destiny was to fight
                                    here to the death.&rdquo;</span></p>

                                    around his hand. He
                                    unleashes it, and Gemini&rsquo;s vision turns to black.</span></p>

                                    real. The kingdom is destroyed, and it seems no one is left there. Whether
                                    it&rsquo;s true or not, he needs
                                    to see it.</span></p>

                                    for, named Cecillion,
                                    comes back. There is no sign of battle in his armor. His helmet is still
                                    intact.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, then.&rdquo; Ravus says to him. He

                                    Gemini already back. &ldquo;There you are! You have been gone for a while by
                                    now.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>

                                    asks him behind his helmet.
                                    &ldquo;You can join the second cart with the others who are sick.&rdquo;</span></p>

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright. Just tired,&rdquo; says Gemini.
                                    &ldquo;Just encountered

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">That maybe will confuse them, but they only need to rest for
                                    now. The problem Gemini
                                    and the party will encounter comes later. Whatever that figure wants with Gemini
                                    seems important and could
                                    put all of them in danger. It involves the pendant to return, but it&rsquo;s only
                                    half of it. Gemini needs
                                    the other half before anyone finds it. If it means to fight to his death, then so be
                                    it.</span></p>
