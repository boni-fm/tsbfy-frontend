                                    with the low lighting reflected in the bonnets, which encapsulate the transition of
                                    day to dusk, marked by
                                    the beautiful sunset. It is the usual mark of time where people return to their home
                                    or even just fancy
                                    themselves to pop up into the nearest restaurant for a dinner after a long
                                    splendorous day in their
                                    activities. </span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c1">From here on, we accompany Raymond, a 32-year-old faithful
                                    husband, who is
                                    responsible as a President Director of an automotive company in Jakarta. As the
                                    traffic packed up nicely in
                                    Jakarta&rsquo;s twilight street, Raymond sat comfortably with his low seating
                                    setting, awakened by the
                                    external noise, yet calm and composed with his peaceful mind as he turned on his
                                    favourite singer, and
                                    probably Raymond&rsquo;s all-time inspiration, Taylor Swift. </span></p>

                                    switched itself from turning red, he took a slight chance to reminisce himself about
                                    how great life turned
                                    out to be. He used to think a lot about how things will pan out in the present, as
                                    people will often remind
                                    him not to rush into things, followed by their Cheshire cat smile. </span><span

                                    lasts forever&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">, as he smirked on his short trip to the
                                    memory lane. In
                                    hindsight, people do come and go, and only a few of them will be committed to
                                    staying in our lane. He knew
                                    that he had to go back home, to find his own wonderland, his peaceful mind. As the
                                    green lights are on,
                                    Raymond snaps himself to focus on driving home, and returning to his lovely wife
                                    where he belongs, and his
                                    beautiful daughter.</span></p>

                                    eagerly welcomed her
                                    dad&rsquo;s presence and hugged him with comfort. </span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Daddy, I met this new transferred friend in class, his

                                    he&rsquo;s so friendly to me. I really wanted to be friends with him
                                    forever!&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Raymond then listened to his young daughter&rsquo;s
                                    friend&rsquo;s discovery with an
                                    affectionate smile, as they sat together in their cozy family room. Betty and
                                    Raymond were soon accompanied
                                    by Dorothea, a hard worker, a beauty on its own, and a wonderful wife. </span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Darling, have you eaten outside?&rdquo;</span><span

                                    class="c1">, Raymond responded

                            </p>

                                    class="c1">asks Raymond
                                    affectionately to Dorothea. </span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It went smooth as usual darling, I made up some really

                                    office, and I managed to prepare dinner for you and Betty today!&rdquo; </span><span

                                    Dorothea with her high spirits as the maid of the family took a day&rsquo;s rest.

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c4">Raymond then responded with some good acknowledgments for
                                    Dorothea, </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Marvellous, love! I&rsquo;m so happy to
                                    hear everything&rsquo;s alright and I&rsquo;m so
                                    proud of you! Oh, how I love you dearly, Dorothea!&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">as
                                    she blushes away with

                            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond then
                                    leaves to take a bath
                                    and prepare dinner with the family. As a small, happy, intelligent family in the
                                    neighbourhood, a brief
                                    catch-up always left the mark of meaningful values on family members every time they
                                    step into the doorway
                                    are just as important to their livelihood, their connection between each other, and
                                    most importantly, their
                                    serenity. It is where each member of the family feels at ease and finds serenity
                                    whenever they are faced
                                    with great difficulties, as it fits to be called &ldquo;home&rdquo;.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Raymond soon is going to have dinner with Dorothea as Betty
                                    accompanies them to the
                                    dining room. Raymond and Dorothea&rsquo;s matrimony and relationship were a bit
                                    touch and go in the first
                                    place. Just like the untied rope, a relationship is probably the very last thing
                                    they could ever think of.
                                    Raymond and Dorothea met in their college days, but there was a slight
                                    misunderstanding when Dorothea
                                    thought that Raymond still had feelings for Augustine, his ex-girlfriend. Thereafter
                                    the moment Raymond
                                    cleared things up with Dorothea, they made a memorable journey along the way,
                                    despite their love blooming in
                                    the very last semester of college. Sure, they had some differences and different
                                    principles, but as we often
                                    knew in tying the rope, it is the differences that made them significant and they
                                    patched up until their
                                    college days over as the work phase starts to arrive, up until the very moment where
                                    they decided to break
                                    the status quo and took a step forward in the holy matrimony and raises a lovely
                                    family together. </span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they
                                    finished dinner and dessert,
                                    Betty asked both her parents, with her eagerly asking the one-million-dollar
                                    question. </span><span class="c2">&ldquo;Dad, how was your first-time experience
                                    meeting with mummy?&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">Betty looks innocently.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Raymond then chuckles for a while and takes his time,
                                    thanking Dorothea for a lovely
                                    dinner and Dorothea smiles upon Betty&rsquo;s innocent question as she is brought
                                    back to the memory
                                    lane.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I think we have our unique quirks in the past. It was
                                    good, bad, joy, and
                                    tears, all mixed up nicely as we were getting along for quite some years from
                                    college and decided to be
                                    together in the end. It was nevertheless an enthralling journey, and it was worth
                                    the experience,
                                    Betty!&rdquo; </span><span class="c4">as Raymond recalled the all&rsquo;s well that

                                    Dorothea. Betty then leaves the dining room with a small kiss from her parents,
                                    along with her little smile
                                    and acknowledgement of her parent&rsquo;s trip down memory lane. </span><span
                                    class="c0">&ldquo;Good night
                                    mum, dad&rdquo;.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Months have
                                    gone by, and Betty is
                                    going to have her graduation ceremony. With all preparations going further, Betty
                                    asked James if he is going
                                    to the same senior high school as Betty intended to. But as Betty figured, James did
                                    not go to the same
                                    local school as Betty would have hoped so. Instead, he is seeking to study abroad
                                    and come along with his
                                    parent&rsquo;s business in New Zealand. Betty was utterly devastated. She turns blue
                                    and the everlasting
                                    rain poured into Betty&rsquo;s gold heart for months.</span></p>

                                    now, Betty took a lot of
                                    time within herself and decided not to take any interest in a relationship, even
                                    with a good-looking boy in
                                    her senior high school. Betty is somewhat looking grim and initially did not accept
                                    things the way it is. As
                                    she walks by the doorway, her dad is in the garden, tending the flowers with care
                                    and so-forth. Aware of her
                                    arrival from school, Raymond greeted Betty.</span></p>

                                    see, it is hard to believe that grieving and the sense of building a detachment to
                                    someone or something,
                                    somehow find their way to run hand in hand. I know that we&rsquo;re often seeing new
                                    people, but eventually,
                                    their novelty will soon turn into ashes and dust. Frankly, sweetie, I will never be
                                    sure how I&rsquo;ve
                                    coped with loss and grievances all my life, but I have just got the inner belief and
                                    a sense of detachment
                                    to what was going on with my life at the time. As you may wake up in the middle of
                                    the night, you may feel
                                    the time is moving, but eventually it will be okay.</span></p>

                                    than believing in yourself to recover, even when you have reached a dire situation.

                            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is detachment itself, dad? Does it have any
                                    relation with our
                                    serenity?&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">asks Betty curiously.</span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Detachment is where you practice a mindful set of
                                    inner beliefs without making
                                    excuses and mind our own business. When things are going well for us, we feel strong
                                    and positive, right?
                                    When we&rsquo;re dealing with loss, grievances, and failure, being detached, and
                                    aiming for our serenity
                                    looks much more appealing than it ever before. It is a baseline of a lifeline, where
                                    we can move out of
                                    acute suffering into something close to our serenity. </span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are
                                    lots of ways we could
                                    figure out in detachment. Desire, fear, and hopelessness in Betty&rsquo;s mind could
                                    soon liberate Betty
                                    into your own serenity, if you got the inner power you needed for and take your
                                    belief into the art of
                                    detachment as something positive to liberate yourself. So yes, detachment actually
                                    has a relation with our
                                    peace of mind. It&rsquo;s just hard to do it at first, but once you get the grip of
                                    yourself, you can
                                    control your willpower and achieve your serenity at last!&rdquo; </span><span
