            <p>
                I always woke up at 6 am, just as my alarm went off. Sometimes I woke up early, but I
                started my activities after hearing the alarm. It has been set up that way, at least these last three years.
                Oliver arranged it for me.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The first thing I did was watering the acacia seedlings near the fence. Oliver said
                he purposely put them there to get enough sun. Yeah, that was a gift from Oliver. He said that I had the
                enthusiasm to do activities in the morning, and when the tree got big, we could see it together. I snorted
                after hearing it but still watered it every morning. My part was only watering. Oliver did the rest, like
                changing the soil, </span><span class="c2">fertilizer</span><span class="c0">, and moving it to a larger
                field. It used to be only as high as my thighs, but then it felt a little taller than me. I could feel the
                leaves hitting the corners of my eyes every time I got close. I was going to ask Oliver to put a hose on so
                I could make it easier to water.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Done with the tree, Myles?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, that was Oliver. I could feel him standing next to me before he closed the
                fence.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As usual,&rdquo; I reply.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He led me to walk inside.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just leave the buzzer there,&rdquo; he said. We went to the terrace for
                breakfast.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is salmon good for breakfast? I woke up a bit late, thought of grilling the
                salmon for a bit and making instant mashed potatoes,&rdquo; he said as he arranged the food, I guess.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; I replied.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mornings were always like this, Oliver came before work to have breakfast together.
                Actually, he didn&rsquo;t need to bother like this. Just left out some instant or frozen food, and I could
                warm it myself up in the microwave.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He came at least three times a day to eat together at lunchtime. He also came after
                work, of course. He said the hospital where he worked was quite far away but insisted on coming anyway. I
                couldn&rsquo;t get rid of him either, could I?</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, he worked at the hospital. More specifically, a doctor. The doctor I met after
                an accident three years ago. He was kind enough to help me after I lost sight in the accident. That was how
                our friendship started until now.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have a surgery scheduled for this afternoon. I will send lunch delivery from
                a restaurant near the hospital.&rdquo; He said that as he cleared the table.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, of course, there were times like this. When he had surgery during the day, he
                would deliver food for me. Not a big deal, of course. Usually, the delivery guy would put the rice box on
                the terrace. I picked it up after getting a call from Oliver.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Forgot to tell you something. I think the tree needs to be moved. Isn&rsquo;t
                it already getting taller? Also, I seem to need a hose to water it more easily.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was silent for a moment, and seemed to be observing the tree.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, we&rsquo;ll do it the day after tomorrow. I don&rsquo;t have any
                schedule. I&rsquo;ll go first, son.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Well, technically, our age gap was quite far. Maybe five or seven years? Of course, I
                had never seen his face and never asked his age, only guessing how old the doctor who would finish his
            </span><span class="c2">specialization</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;program. But it felt weird to be called that
                by someone I had never seen.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oliver was like a friend and a parent because I had been living alone for so long. My
                mother&rsquo;s husband left us when I was little, and my mother became a drunkard. I spent several years
                with my mother before my aunt decided to take care of me and send me to school. Then I was accepted at the
                University in this city and decided to start living on my own, continuing my studies while doing part-time
                jobs.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">I </span><span class="c2">would</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;never forget the
                accident. I remembered clearly what the face of the bespectacled man sitting behind the wheel looked like. I
                heard from my aunt that he escaped prison and chose to pay the fine. Of course, he must be wealthy.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oliver said it was difficult to find eye donors in our city, but he kept trying to
                find eye donors from the central eye bank.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wanted to get my sight back. I used to think I&rsquo;d meet that guy after I got
                the eye donor and punched him at least once, but it was all over the place. Maybe it was because of that bad
                intention I didn&rsquo;t immediately get an eye donor. I wanted to go back to college and get on with my
                life. Maybe I wanted to be a doctor like Oliver. I also wanted to see his face and thank him. Then the
                acacia tree in the yard, I wanted to see it too.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oliver came a bit late that day because he didn&rsquo;t have a schedule.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I woke up late,&rdquo; he said. As we promised the other day, we would move
                the acacia tree to the ground, no more pots because it was quite big. We started moving it after breakfast.
                I was not much help, only when Oliver told me to slide or hold something. We also installed a hose to make
                it easier to water the tree.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could imagine the tree now. It must be standing tall in the garden without a pot.
                You don&rsquo;t think about a house with a narrow yard. The yard was grass with a wooden fence. That house
                belonged to Oliver, and he lived in my apartment at the moment. In short, we swapped places. He said it was
                better that way so that I wouldn&rsquo;t be confined in a small room and get lots of fresh air. I
                didn&rsquo;t know what this house looked like, but I thought it&rsquo;s quite big. I once asked why he
                didn&rsquo;t live there with me, since that house belonged to him. He said that my apartment needed someone
                to look after. Tell me, was there anyone kinder than Oliver? I owed him a lot.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good news from the central corneal bank. I have resubmitted them, and you got
                the first queue.&rdquo; He spoke while hugging my shoulder and shaked it lightly.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, that&#39;s good news.&rdquo; I replied with a smile.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got excited to hear that. I wished I could have my eyesight again, and I hoped this
                time luck was on my side.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And luck was really on my side. Oliver came rushing one afternoon between hours when
                we had just finished lunch an hour ago. But I heard the gate open rather loudly, and he started shouting my
                name before he even entered. I waited a while for him to catch his breath. To be honest, I was getting
                nervous too. I felt like I knew what this was, but my mind was churning, refusing to make any small hopes,
                but I was very, very sure. I gently squeezed the pants I was wearing.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Didn&rsquo;t you just come here?&rdquo; I decided to start
                the conversation. </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes... right. I mean... this is a job... this is also a job... I... God !! You
                get a donor, Myles! You got it!!&rdquo; He shaked my body. </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I felt my soul leaving my body. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that. Was that true? I had
                been waiting for this moment for two years, and it felt unreal. I was getting very, very nervous. The first
                thing that popped into my head was Oliver. He was the person I wanted to see the most for the first time. I
                was really nervous. Would this work?</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We immediately rushed to the hospital. I also called my aunt, and she was so happy
                about it, I heard her almost scream. She said she would be here soon. I did some checks, not too many,
                because I also routinely did check-ups to see the state of my eyes. Again, it was Oliver as my guardian, who
                suggested that. He said it would make the procedure to get a donor easier.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was really nervous when I was about to enter the surgery room. My aunt has arrived
                here, and Oliver was also with my aunt. I didn&rsquo;t know why I was really nervous. Even though I
                couldn&rsquo;t see it, I could feel my aunt and Oliver&rsquo;s nervousness and it made me even more nervous.
                Everything would go smoothly, right?</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hadn&rsquo;t seen Oliver since I woke up from surgery. It had been three weeks, and
                my eyesight was getting better. My aunt said he had urgent matters out of town. I was a little disappointed,
                but still I couldn&rsquo;t see very well either, so I thought I would see them when my eyesight was perfect.
                My aunt had been accompanying me for the past three weeks because I still had to go to the doctor for
                checkups until I could really see clearly. I could already see what the acacia tree planted in the yard
                looked like. It was really taller than me. Many things turned out to be far different from what I expected.
                For example, Oliver&rsquo;s house. I thought it was brick red like farm houses in general, but it turned out
                to be much more beautiful with similar shades of white and greenery all around the house. I wondered how
                Oliver took care of it all by himself before me because, hey, I was only just finding out now!</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I actually gradually recovered pretty quickly. I could see clearly without
                glasses, and my eyes didn&rsquo;t water much anymore. That day would be my last check-up, but Oliver never
                showed himself at all. I didn&rsquo;t even have his cell number. The doctor said I could check up again next
                month, which means I was 99% recovered. My Aunt and I bought some bread before we headed home. Seeing the
                red light, I was reminded of the accident again. But I thought I had forgotten it. I really didn&rsquo;t
                want to remember it anymore because I felt happier then. I felt I could be more grateful for many things.
                Until the moment we crossed the fence, I saw him.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man with glasses, whom I saw three years ago, was standing on the terrace of the
                house, looking straight at me. I was even cursing myself for just saying I didn&rsquo;t want to remember
                that accident but thinking of his face instead. But that face was totally real! I almost lost my sanity,
                even ignoring my Aunt, who tried to put her arm around my shoulder. I walked briskly towards him, with my
                eyes starting to feel warm. My emotions were really out of control.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I quickly grabbed his collar and looked at his face. It was that face! The face I
                last saw three years ago and one that I would always remember. I raised my hand and was about to punch him
                until he started talking.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;Hello, Myles!&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That voice! Oliver.</span></p>
