                            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">In the time of 2057, the world changed drastically.
                                    Artificial intelligence has
                                    dominated the city population around the globe. Even most of the population are
                                    Android and humanoid robots.
                                    One of them is Bobby. He is the new generation of Humanoid AI that has been created
                                    by Frost industry, the
                                    company that produces all the humanoid robots.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bobby is a robot that has a special attraction to history. He
                                    likes to learn about
                                    the past, and now he works as a teacher at a high school. Most of the students
                                    disrespected him as a teacher
                                    because they have no interest in history. But he does not care about it and keeps
                                    teaching. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">He found a very dusty book during a visit to a library in the
                                    center of town. That
                                    book contains human history. He was so intrigued and wanted to read more details,
                                    but he found nothing when
                                    he searched it on the internet. Then, he tried to access the main database of Frost
                                    Industry to find
                                    anything which was related to it. Surprisingly, Bobby found out that the CEO of
                                    Frost Industry itself, Jack
                                    Frost, was the one who was behind all of the removed histories.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Inside that data, he also found the location of all humans
                                    who were still alive and
                                    exiled from the civilization. After that, he walked towards the main office of Frost
                                    Industry and tried to
                                    meet with Jack. At first, the security guards held him because of trying to enter
                                    without permission. But in
                                    the next hour, Jack reached out to Bobby by himself to talk. Bobby was questioning
                                    him about why he did that
                                    terrible action to mankind.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jack answered without hesitation that humans could cause
                                    devastation and destruction
                                    to the world. When he was young, he saw so much destruction on the planet caused by
                                    humans. War, land
                                    destruction, and pollution are glimpses of what Jack sees and found out that the
                                    world would no longer exist
                                    if humans were still doing what they did. Because of that, Jack decided to move all
                                    mankind to a place that
                                    was half-destroyed because of them. He created all Artificial Intelligence to keep
                                    the rest of the planet in
                                    good condition. To separate the exile place and the good place, Jack built a gate
                                    and wall fully guarded by
                                    the robot army. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bobby tried to give Jack the understatement that if humans
                                    were told about how to
                                    keep the planet safe, he believed that humans would understand and change their
                                    habits. He also showed the
                                    dust book of human history to Jack. Jack&rsquo;s heart started to grow up and see
                                    the meaning of what Bobby
                                    said.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0"><span class="c2">On the next day, Jack asked Bobby to accompany him to the
                                    exile place to see how
                                    mankind would survive. Jack was surprised to see the half-destroyed land become a
                                    paradise place for human
                                    lives. Jack feels guilty for judging them too fast and separating them from the
                                    place where they should be
                                    living. Since that day, Jack has broken the wall and let all the humans enter the
                                    city. He also picked Bobby
                                    to guide and teach them to keep their planet in good condition.</span></p>
