                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man was about to close his eyes when choked sobs and
                                    sniffs pulled him out of his
                                    trance. He looked to the side, spotting a young girl standing a few feet away with
                                    both hands on the
                                    railings. Her knuckles were white with how strong she held onto the mildew handrails
                                    and shoulders shaking
                                    violently beneath the thick coats she wore.</span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Uhh... Hey!&quot; The girl snapped her attention to him
                                    in an instant. Her dark
                                    eyes brimmed with tears that steadily trailed down pale cheeks past a pair of lips
                                    that twisted into a
                                    sorrowful grimace. A million emotions flashed through her glassy orbs. Distraught,
                                    remorse, guilt, hurt and
                                    sadness.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wanna talk about it?&quot; He proposed gently, trying
                                    to appear as harmless as
                                    possible. The girl just stared at him in confusion and distrust. Well, not every day
                                    a stranger was willing
                                    to hear your story, let alone the one asked you to tell them. Also, there was that
                                    stranger danger rule
                                    which parents and teachers like to remind the youngling any chance they get.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;How about we go to the stall over there? Sounds
                                    good?&quot; As if reading her
                                    mind, the guy pointed at the nearby food stall that was packed with townsfolk. A
                                    place where she could
                                    easily call for help if he ever attempted to harm her. Not that he would anyway.
                                    &quot;I won&#39;t force you
                                    to, but it&#39;s better to let it all out than bottling up. Don&#39;t you think
                                    so?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The girl looked at the small but homey stall, seemingly
                                    contemplating her choice,
                                    then faced the man again. Her round head timidly nodded as she tucked a strand of
                                    curly dark hair behind her
                                    ear.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Then, let&#39;s go,&quot; They made their way over.
                                    Weaving among the crowds of
                                    scary-looking sailors and grubby kids running around the dock. A few moments later,
                                    they found themselves
                                    sitting on empty barrels just beside the food stalls, a cup of hot chocolate warming
                                    their hands from the
                                    cold, harsh sea breeze.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Whenever you are ready,&quot; The young girl opened and
                                    closed her chapped lips
                                    a few times, still hesitant to tell her story. But after a few moments of silence,
                                    she made up her mind and
                                    started talking.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">She talked about herself and her family and how she was
                                    constantly compared to her
                                    siblings. How she was never good enough for her parents no matter what she did. Her
                                    childlike voice grew
                                    shakier as her story went on, and so did her pale slender hands.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;-It was so unfair. You know? I had worked hard to
                                    achieve anything I could to
                                    make them proud, but I&#39;m not my siblings... I&#39;m not a genius like my brother
                                    or good at household
                                    matters like my sister. A-and for that, I wasn&#39;t enough.&quot; Her gaze found
                                    him in a desperate way of
                                    asking for him to understand. &quot;I was so depressed. I don&#39;t know what to
                                    do,&quot; She averted her
                                    eyes downward, staring mournfully at her pair of worn-out boots.</span></p>

                                    with a hurt look in her
                                    eyes.</span></p>

                                    parents. Just be yourself and do what you think is right,&quot; He looked down at
                                    the girl, a faint smile on
                                    his thin lips. &quot;You can&#39;t please everybody, and it&#39;s fine. As long as
                                    you stay true to
                                    yourself, the people that accept you with open arms are the only ones that are worth

                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">She scrunched up her nose in confusion. &quot;I don&#39;t get
                                    it.&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What I meant was,&quot; He took a sip of his drink.
                                    &quot;You should talk to
                                    your parents, get them to understand that you aren&#39;t your siblings and that you
                                    too have your
                                    achievement that they should at least acknowledge too,&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;And if they won&#39;t budge?&quot; He shrugged.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Then you just have to hang in there until you are old
                                    enough to fend for
                                    yourself and move out, I guess,&quot; The girl pouted, looking dejected as she
                                    lowered her head down to her
                                    chest. &quot;Listen,&quot; She looked up slowly.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;If that&#39;s not enough to motivate you to keep going,
                                    how about keeping small
                                    goals? Do you have someone you want to meet?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well... I have a friend who lives across the
                                    city....&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c5 c6">&quot;Then, keep hanging on until you meet them. Or you
                                    can have any other small
                                    goals worth looking forward to. There must be something in this world that you
                                    haven&#39;t tried yet. Make
                                    that your motivation to keep going,&quot; He smiled when watching the sadness
                                    leaving her dark eyes bit by
                                    bit. &quot;It would be such a waste to lose another brave soul to the darkness.
                                    Don&#39;t let them drag you
                                    down. You are worth so much more than what they told you,&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c5 c6"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c5 c6">The girl averted her gaze shyly to the side, and a small
                                    smile bloomed on her pale
                                    lips. &quot;... I&#39;m not brave,&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c5 c6"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c5 c6">&quot;You&#39;ve told me your story, and that alone was
                                    enough proof,&quot;</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c5 c6"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c5 c6">&quot;Okay then,&quot; She stood up, a new determination
                                    shining in her now clear
                                    eyes. The man followed in suit. &quot;I guess I better get going now. Thank you so
                                    much...&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c5 c6"></span></p>

                                    Y</span><span class="c5 c6">ou&#39;ve saved my life,&quot; She tilted her head to
                                    the side. &quot;Will you be here
                                    tomorrow?&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c5 c6"></span></p>
                            <p class="c3"><span class="c5">&quot;Well... I&#39;m here every evening. Unless something
                                    came up,&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Great!&quot; Her lips stretched into a wide grin,
                                    showing a set of cute bunny
                                    teeth. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow then,&quot;</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">With that, she left him on the now less busy dock. Her head
                                    of long, curly black hair
                                    swished along as she walked with a little skip in her step. Seemingly happier and
                                    more relaxed compared to
                                    the girl she was half an hour ago.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man watched until her small back vanished among the
                                    crowds. Felt something in his
                                    chest lighten after helping another soul to their way of happiness. Well, at least
                                    he hopes so. He walked to
                                    the edge of the dock. Peering at his reflection on the dark surface of the sea. But
                                    instead of the thoughts
                                    he was having earlier, there&#39;s nothing left. Just a faint buzz of warmth filled
                                    up his supposedly empty
                                    heart. He sighed, then turned away from the edge.</span></p>
