                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is a sense of reckless bravery within every young boyhood&rsquo;s dream, as
                                well as the banal understanding of adventure engraved deep within the bones of children. Julian Smith, a
                                young man from a small village, is not foreign to this concept. He thrives his whole life following this
                                reckless pipe dream like a bird learning how to fly from its nest for the first time. He was wholehearted
                                and ready to plummet down and immerse himself in the adventures provided in the lands unknown.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, life is not that idealistic, nor fate was kind.</span></p>
                        <p class="c7"><span class="c0">&mdash; q &mdash;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The world crumbled around him on a sunny afternoon, perfect for sightseeing compared
                                to others. The irony was a cruel and hilarious thing that comes when you least expect it. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were supposed to do a simple side quest, something to do along the way as they
                                took the hard trek across the continent. The party consisted of 5 adventurers. One of them was a hotheaded
                                aristocrat as the group leader. Ravus Mason gave the group a proper briefing of the plan as they stood under
                                the southern part of the forest region within the quest area. The scout mission &mdash;because that was the
                                only way to describe what they were doing&mdash; required them to enter a cavern that reported sightings of
                                an unknown monster and confirm the threat without engaging against it. Of course, that was when the plane
                                started to unravel.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Julian, the weakest who acted as the bard and the support healer, fancied himself to
                                be a brave man. He planned to make the journey outside the comfort of his quaint and peaceful village along
                                with his twin sister and the party&rsquo;s second warlock, Josselyn. So he immediately and foolishly decided
                                to cancel his plan as soon as they entered the mouth of the cave, which made the group annoyed.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo; Ravus asked almost aggressively as soon as he
                            </span><span class="c2">realized</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the bard was moving deeper into the dark cave. Not
                                like what they strategized, his left hand slightly hovering like he was ready to snatch the other man.
                                &ldquo;Are you an imbecile?!&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Both the young men barely got along well, under the mutual understanding of bare
                                tolerance towards one another. They were complete opposites to each other. Julian came from a blacksmith
                                family with humbling backgrounds. Ravus was the son of a duke and the sole heir of a sizable estate before
                                his occupation as an adventurer. They were also opposite in views. Ravus was a realist bordering on
                            </span><span class="c2">skepticism</span><span class="c0">, often giving sniping remarks and brutal criticism as
                                his preferred form of communication. Julian was unrelentingly optimistic. He was so optimistic, that it was
                                bordering on their idealism. Not only that, but the bard was also absent-minded, a wide-eyed country bumpkin
                                with too much of an optimistic view but with very little luck.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Julian decided to ignore the last bit of the question thrown at him,
                                &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you, at least, curious about what the monster looks like?&rdquo; he pushed forward with
                                a torch in hand. The light from the fire casts undecipherable shadowed over the uneven walls of the cavern,
                                and it gave an eerie feeling of an unwanted observer hiding in the darkness. From somewhere behind the rear
                                of the party, there was Gemini Del Amer as the second-in-command as the party&rsquo;s cleric and voice of
                                reason. With an almost tired manner stated that they must not rush into danger carelessly, regardless of
                                whether curiosity is involved or not. &nbsp;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Different from the reckless Julian and aggressively sarcastic Ravus, the redheaded
                                Triton &mdash;a humanoid piscean race&mdash; was aloof and cool-headed, coming from his background as a
                                crown prince from a neighbouring country. He was never cold. He tried his best to heal his party
                                members&rsquo; injuries, despite how many stupid stunts they pulled with only a sigh and their half-hearted
                                comments. Opted to strategize the next plan or route the party would take instead of joining Ravus and
                                Julian&rsquo;s ridiculous competition to woo patrons in the taverns they visited. Of course he again tried
                                to act as the voice of reason for the group.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be fine as long as we stay together and be careful,&rdquo; Julian
                                reasoned with a grin, &ldquo;besides, I&rsquo;m getting better with my rapier.&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ravus shot him a disbelieving look and smacked the back of the bard&rsquo;s
                                unprotected knees with the dull side of his sword to prove a point. Julian let out a surprised yelp. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Was that necessary?&rdquo; Josselyn scolded somewhere in the back, slightly
                                perplexed by the treatment that her brother received. If Julian had bad luck, then his twin sister absorbed
                                all the good ones. Josselyn was a fellow warlock and the only female at the party. She also had the
                                ridiculous luck and power in her deceptively cheerful and often nervous personality, even surpassing Ravus,
                                who had proper training. Josselyn </span><span class="c2">tend</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to stick between
                                her brother and Ophiucus, but lately asked Ravus to guide her on some of her spell works. However, she still
                                prefered to stay beside her brother and the party&rsquo;s rogue. Ophiucus was the final member of the party
                                as the quietest one, an Aarakocra &mdash;a hybrid of human and avian&mdash; rogue that seems to be too soft
                                and kind for his occupation. Currently, he looks like he would rather be anywhere else than get stuck in the
                                crossfire between the other members.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they began to bicker more heavily, a sudden rumble shook the entirety of the cave.
                                The stalactites started to fall from the top of them, like an almost ridiculous rendition of the swords of
                                Damocles. Julian gave another undignified yelp as Ravus yanked him from becoming a target of one of the
                                sharp ends of nature&rsquo;s deathtrap. Both men fell to the dirt with a loud &lsquo;oomph!&rsquo;. From
                                behind, Ophiucus tried to tug Josselyn to the mouth of the cavern to witness it collapse under the weight of
                                the heavy boulders that were acting as the roof. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; Gemini yelled as he dodged falling rocks, waving them to enter
                                deeper into the cave to avoid more of the falling obstacles. His voice was barely audible over the continued
                                rumble.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They ran for their lives as the roof started to cave in more, Gemini using his shield
                                at the front while both Ravus and Josselyn tried their best to blast the stray rocks away from them. Julian
                                was sinking. Felt the mortality forced him to run faster than he had ever done in his life. </span></p>
                        <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c2">Upfront tunnel began to widen, and the rumble lessened to a barely-there
                                vibration. They stopped at a space inside a cave that looked similar to a circular room with two other paths
                                branching. Before they could collapse to the ground, a loud growl was heard from above them. In an almost
                                comedic manner, their terrified eyes shot up to wherever the source of the noise was.</span></p>
                        <p class="c4"><span class="c3 c2">Somewhere beside him, Julian can hear Ravus swearing loudly while Josselyn gave a
                                frightened gasp. &ldquo;Of all of the monsters hiding in this hole,&rdquo; Gemini groaned tiredly from
                                behind as they watched a grey orc observing them while hanging from the side of the cavern wall. Julian
                                feels faint as he watches the orc give them a particularly terrifying grin with all of his teeth on display.
                            </span></p>
                        <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to die</span><span class="c2 c9">.&rsquo; he mourned
                                silently.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Like a puppet cut from its strings, everyone sprung to combat as the 6 feet tall
                                creature gave a roar and thumped its hands to the wall, causing stalactites and part of the roof to fall.
                                Ravus rolled on his sides to avoid Ophiucus flying away. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We need to even the ground!&rdquo; the warlock yelled behind him, aligning
                                herself enough to try to blast one of the orc&rsquo;s hands holding the wall with her spell. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Josselyn gave a quick nod before running to the other side, &ldquo;I call upon thee
                                for power and blood, O&rsquo;Being of Olde; Eldritch blast!&rdquo; She chanted a spell that produced black
                                flames on her hands which she threw in the general direction of the monster.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gemini stabbed his greatsword to the ground along with his shield, chanting a prayer
                                of protection to the surrounding radius. Right on time as the orc decided he had enough and threw a sizable
                                boulder ripped straight from the walls at them. The rock created a deafening thud as it hitted the top part
                                of the Triton&rsquo;s yellowish shield spell, made the whole thing vibrate.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How are we going to defeat that?!&rdquo; Julian yelled almost
                                hysterically.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grey orcs are not as strong as the normal ones, but they&rsquo;re master
                                tacticians,&rdquo; Gemini greeted with his teeth, &ldquo;the earthquake we felt must&rsquo;ve been a trap to
                                lure us in deeper.&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, bloody fun&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; Josselyn yelled in despair as Ophiucus flew too close to the
                                orc. They watched it helplessly as the monster batted him away like an incessant fly. Ravus swore again as
                                he tried to blast the orc off. Only success could piss it off more.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Josselyn, help me distract it!&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c3">The female warlock started to cast a volley of black flames that she threw at the
                                grey orc. The ground aggressively shook as it hitted the target. Julian tried his best to carry the injured
                                hybrid avian within the shield. He checked for minor injuries, deducing that the rogue must have torn a
                                muscle when he bounced off the uneven cavern walls.</span></p>
                        <p class="c4"><span class="c2 c5">&quot;Please, don&rsquo;t die, please! I will be more careful next
                                time.&quot;</span><span class="c2 c9">&nbsp;Julian chanted in his mind as he tried his best to heal the
                                pale-looking man. Julian was never actually trained as a proper healer. He only took the role due to his
                                clumsy nature in their adventures as his reluctance to put more burden on Gemini, who was the actual healer.
                                He was starting to doubt his ability before giving an exhale of relief as the wounds began to close.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another loud boom began to echo within the cave as one of Josselyn&rsquo;s spells
                                managed the grey orc lose his grip from his perch. He landed heavily on the ground before gave an angry roar
                                and banging his chest. Ravus gave a loud battle cry as he unsheathed his black sword and charged forward.
                                The orc tried to smack him away, but he dodged skillfully, used his magic to boost himself airborne. Gemini
                                tried to bind the monster to the grown with his own spell. Josselyn continued with her volley of
                                spells.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly as fast as lighting, the orc swiftly took out a giant ax from its back and
                                swung it to intercept with Ravus&rsquo;s own sword. It took him out if not for his cushioning spells. Julian
                                swore loudly and tried his best to run towards his sister, who seemed to be the orc&rsquo;s next target as
                                it swung a wide downward arch towards her. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For a moment, he saw her. Then she was gone under the dust and debris.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A horrified yell vibrated through the walls that Julian detachedly realized came from
                                him. Seeing the shaken man and the fallen warlock, &nbsp;Gemini stopped his protection spell by lifting his
                                greatsword and shield to help them fight. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, that was their first mistake. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The grey orc gave them a terrifying grin before suddenly throwing the ax at Ravus,
                                who was still trying to attack the orc relentlessly. It forced the warlock to evade and gave space between
                                them. The orc then took out a small device from his pouch. It looked at the remaining party members,
                                mocking. It gave them an almost creepily human-like wave to taunt them before throwing the device to the
                                ground and running off to the exit path on the left side.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Julian let out a terrified gasp as he recognized rumble from the start of their quest
                                was once again present. Almost threw the injured Ophiucus, who was secretly trying to drag the passed-out
                                Josselyn away off balance. The ground shook hard enough, and the floors began to crack. Ravus held an
                                injured shoulder and a bloodied head. He threw a desperate glance towards the path where the orc left before
                                yelling for them to run, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll use the same exit!&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">They started to run towards the exit as fast as their feet could carry them, dodging
                                fallen rocks and cracking floors below them. Julian helped Ophiucus </span><span class="c2">carr</span><span
                                class="c0">y his unconscious sister while Gemini tried to shield them, and Ravus led the way. A sense of
                                desperation and dread hanging over their head as they push harder. The floor in front of them gave way, and
                                Ravus hastily jumped over, followed by the red-haired Triton and the avian hybrid. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Realized</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that his hands were full, Julian shot the party
                                members with a terrified look. Gemini sensed his insecurity, and tried to calm him down.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just throw her here, and we&rsquo;ll catch her, and then you will
                                jump.&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you drop her, I will wreck you.&rdquo; the bard said with a wave of
                                protectiveness.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, now do it!&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a huff and a swing, he threw his sister&rsquo;s unconscious body across the
                                chasm to the waiting arms of Ravus and Ophiucus, gave a loud groan as the heavyweight forced them to strain
                                their injured arms. However, she landed safely, and he gave a loud exhale of relief.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, my turn now.&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He called them from the other side. Their hands stretched to grab him. In case he
                                didn&#39;t make the jump. More boulders and stalactites began to fall as the ground shook harder. Julian
                                inhaled sharply to prepare himself before running to the edge and leaping with his hands outstretched. He
                                jumped.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tere lay their second mistake. They waited too long and were so distracted by
                                Josselyn that they didn&rsquo;t realize how the floor began to fall at an accelerating speed, widening the
                                gap that separated Julian and the other party members even more.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">His fingertips lightly grazed theirs before the world around him crumbled, and the
                                ground beneath him disappeared. </span></p>
