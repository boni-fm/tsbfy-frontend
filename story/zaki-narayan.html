                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3">Love is one of the important things in everyone&#39;s
                                    life. Love can be directed
                                    to anyone in our lives. Parents, friends, pets, and also someone who will be a
                                    friend for life until the end
                                    of life. When feelings of love arise from both sides of the human being, it can
                                    create a very close
                                    relationship. But if the feeling of love is only one-sided, it can be very painful
                                    and traumatic for some
                                    people. Yes, you could say unrequited love. Maybe not many have experienced it, but
                                    for some people,
                                    unrequited love can be a pretty deep trauma and can make the person afraid to fall
                                    in love again after that.
                                    Just like what happened to Zach. Just like what happened to Zach. Unrequited love is
                                    a new thing in
                                    Zach&#39;s life. He is a good man, patient, loving, and never rude to those he
                                    loves. Zach is also a humble
                                    person and always puts the interests of others first. Unrequited love is a new
                                    problem for Zach, who just
                                    separated from his ex-girlfriend a few months ago. Since Zach separated from his
                                    ex-girlfriend, he often
                                    talks to his best friend named Anne. Anne is a small adorable woman, with slanted
                                    eyes and shoulder-length
                                    hair. Zach doesn&#39;t have any feelings for Anne. Zach really thinks Anne is his
                                    best friend because they
                                    often exchange stories with each other about many things. Such as education, work,
                                    family, and others. Anne
                                    has always been a good listener to Zach, and vice versa. Zach talks more about his
                                    love life, and Anne talks
                                    more about the worries in her life. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3">Anne is a cheerful woman and has a very positive aura when
                                    around her. She is also
                                    very loving to her parents, and very good at controlling herself when in trouble.
                                    Zach doesn&#39;t talk to
                                    Anne regularly enough, only on a few occasions. Zach also doesn&#39;t feel love for
                                    Anne at all. If so, then
                                    why did Zach suddenly fall in love with Anne? Even though Anne is not trying to make
                                    Zach comfortable, just
                                    being a good listener. In a few moments, Zach had a feeling &quot;Is she the right
                                    person?&quot; against
                                    Anne. The cause may be fairly common. Together with Anne, Zach feels more valued as
                                    a man. Anne also
                                    sometimes likens herself to be Zach&#39;s girlfriend in some of the stories that
                                    Zach tells. For example,
                                    when Zach tells about his ex-girlfriend who doesn&#39;t appreciate Zach&#39;s
                                    efforts and throws harsh words
                                    that hurt Zach. Anne also argued, &quot;If I were your girlfriend, maybe I
                                    wouldn&#39;t do that. That&#39;s
                                    definitely not a natural trait of a woman. She shouldn&#39;t be swallowed up by her
                                    own ego and cornered
                                    you, Zach.&quot; Opinions like that several times make Zach blush and bring a little
                                    feeling of falling in
                                    love with Anne. The way he listens to Anne, who is very patient and always aware of
                                    Zach&#39;s position in
                                    his relationship, is also one aspect of why Zach fell in love with Anne. Zach had
                                    also met with Anne several
                                    times and exchanged stories about their life. This meeting makes Zach also quite
                                    fall in love with Anne
                                    because there are many things that trigger it. The gestures that Anne made to Zach
                                    several times made Zach
                                    blush and feel awkward. For example, Anne said, &quot;Never mind, Zach, you are a
                                    good person, you don&#39;t
                                    deserve to be treated like that&quot; while stroking and lightly patting Zach&#39;s
                                    shoulder. Anne also
                                    laughed out loud a few times while hitting Zach&#39;s shoulder or hand with
                                    exasperation. Which made Zach
                                    blush again deep down in his heart.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3">Basically, apart from Anne&#39;s way of thinking that
                                    caught Zach&#39;s attention,
                                    Anne&#39;s gestures and words made Zach blush a lot and start to fall in love with
                                    Anne. Zach is almost
                                    interested in all aspects of Anne. He likes women who have short hair, likes women
                                    who are cheerful, and
                                    likes women who are loving and not easily provoked by emotions. All of that is in
                                    Anne. </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3">But one thing that holds Zach from expressing his feelings
                                    is, that Anne is just
                                    his best friend, who probably can&#39;t have a relationship more than that. It&#39;s
                                    also possible that Anne
                                    doesn&#39;t have the same feelings as Zach. It also becomes a barrier for Zach to
                                    express his feelings. Zach
                                    really wants to express his feelings, but Zach is afraid of telling the truth, Anne
                                    becomes distant from
                                    Zach, and may not be friends anymore. Zach really doesn&#39;t want to lose Anne.
                                    Zach once cried at certain
                                    moments just thinking about what he should do with Anne. Do you have to express your
                                    feelings or just be
                                    quiet and wait for time? Especially with Zach who hasn&#39;t finished with his past
                                    with his ex, Zach of
                                    course has doubts about his feelings. He was afraid to only make Anne an outlet for
                                    his heartache. At one
                                    point, Zach was contemplating his feelings, aligning his mind and heart to match the
                                    question within
                                    himself, &quot;Am I really in love with Anne, or is it just temporary?&quot;.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3">There was one moment when Zach was sure of himself and his
                                    feelings. When Zach met
                                    Anne and his other friends, then Zach took Anne home on a motorbike, and Zach really
                                    felt a very deep love
                                    that made Zach&#39;s heart beat fast and made goosebumps. When Anne talks to Zach on
                                    the motorbike, Zach
                                    feels comfortable. Zach also couldn&#39;t contain himself when Anne grabbed his hand
                                    to say goodbye. Anne
                                    said, &quot;Be careful on the road, I hope you stay happy always&quot;, while
                                    holding Zach&#39;s hand for a
                                    long time plus looking into Zach&#39;s eyes. Indeed it was just an act of saying
                                    goodbye. It&#39;s different
                                    for Zach, what makes it possible is his best moment with Anne which makes Zach
                                    unable to contain his
                                    embarrassment and admiration for Anne. At that moment, which took place at the cafe,
                                    Zach took several
                                    photos with Anne. The photo is still often looked at by Zach every night. Zach could
                                    only stare at the photo
                                    and hope for a miracle to come. There was a moment when Zach was awakened by his
                                    friend who said, &quot;What
                                    if Anne suddenly tells you about a boy who wants to be with her, and Anne is also
                                    attracted to him? You
                                    don&#39;t want that moment to happen when you still have the same feelings for
                                    her?&rdquo;. At that moment
                                    Zach He is considering whether he should express his feelings to Anne by risking his
                                    friendship status which
                                    might make Zach lose Anne because Anne is away from him, or maybe Zach will get a
                                    positive response because
                                    Anne has the same feelings, but Zach always thinks the worst first.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3">Until now, Zach could only admire Anne from a distance.
                                    And can only dream of
                                    having a future life with Anne. Zach is trapped in his own insecurity as well. Zach
                                    feels unworthy of Anne.
                                    Zach felt he was not handsome enough for a beautiful woman like Anne. What would
                                    Anne&#39;s friends say if
                                    she had a boyfriend who wasn&#39;t handsome and unattractive? Zach also feels
                                    ashamed of himself for not
                                    doing enough in academics. Meanwhile, Anne is very studious and is always on time
                                    for her assignments. The
                                    material aspect is also something that makes Zach feel inappropriate for Anne. Zach
                                    is not from a rich
                                    family. Zach doesn&#39;t feel like he can give Anne much materialist stuff. Zach
                                    only capitalized on love
                                    and sincerity. Zach still often sees his photos with Anne. And still often see
                                    Anne&#39;s Instagram.
                                    Admiring how sweet and cute Anne is at night is Zach&#39;s activity at times. The
                                    risk that Zach bears is
                                    quite large. He didn&#39;t want to lose Anne&#39;s trust. He didn&#39;t want to be
                                    shunned by Anne. But
                                    he&#39;s also afraid that Anne&#39;s relationship with someone else will suddenly
                                    break Zach&#39;s heart.
                                    Zach could only bury his feelings deep inside. Refrain from telling Anne.</span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3">In the end, Zach can only let go of his feelings if Anne
                                    has a boyfriend in the
                                    future. Zach can only wish Anne the best for now. Hope Anne can do her best for her
                                    studies, and for her
                                    work. Zach doesn&#39;t want to bother Anne by expressing his feelings, only adding
                                    to Anne&#39;s burden.
                                    Maybe one day Zach will tell Anne about his feelings, whatever the risk. Because
                                    that feeling is very stuck
                                    in Zach&#39;s heart. Zach must be sincere with any answer Anne. Zach will probably
                                    be waiting for Anne for
                                    an undetermined amount of time. But clearly, Zach is very in love with Anne, and
                                    Zach hopes Anne has the
                                    same feelings as him. Zach felt this might be unrequited love for him.</span></p>
