            <p>
                Since they left seven months ago, a smile rarely appears on these lips, accompanied
                by quiet sobs. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I could say that I am a versatile girl since everything that I have done has always
                been adequate to the point that my surroundings always rely on me when they need to do anything. My days are
                always busy. Besides just being a third-year college student, I work as an audit staff member for a
                corporation to help my family financially. Regardless of how exhausted or busy my schedule is, work
                activities are always enjoyable because I can show my parents that they can rely on me whenever needed.
            </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">After getting used to all the schedules, now I can manage my time quite well between
                work and College. It was challenging since I did not have any experience studying while working. I even have
                had an academic burnout where I felt tired and anxious about the papers all the time. However, I tried my
                best and &nbsp;grew accustomed to it; my grades continued to improve while my work performances kept getting
                better. &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once I graduated from high school, I setted a goal in which I want to get higher
                education without adding any burden to my parents. With my goals, I always try my best and become an
                ambitious person in every work I get. I try to earn money by myself and rely on scholarship money for
                college needs. Thus I am so grateful that I was given such sustenance through a chance to enter College
                without paying the tuition fee myself. Once again, my parents were not workers who had a big salary; my
                father was a non-pensioner who received just severance pay at the time, and my mother, who was 57 at the
                time, worked at home as a tailor with a small income because people are looking for a well-educated tailor
                who has a good record in designing clothes. Thus it would become such a heavy burden if I ask them to pay my
                tuition fee.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I returned 14, seven years ago to be exact, my father was retired from his job.
                It was the time I started to feel the real taste of life. Sometimes I feel sweet and sugary, while most of
                the time, I feel bitter. I could not afford what my friends could get from their parents. He got a pension
                fund but that was all the money we had, thus we tended to use it wisely as possible. My family utilized the
                money to launch businesses like a plastic shop, a sewing service for my mother, and even a motorcycle and
                vehicle wash service, hoping that the company would last for a long time. Unfortunately, led to Father&#39;s
                lack of financial ability; we were misled into committing $30 million to a friend of Father&#39;s, which he
                promised would be invested.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">As time went by, we tried to forget the incident and had a happy life. My father got
                hired as a driver by a very productive store near our house. We were grateful even though the salary was not
                enough to support our lives. Yet he could not use all his energy since he was getting old. Every time he got
                home, he always looked pale and tired. Until seven months ago, suddenly my father felt sick, which was quite
                serious. We immediately took him to the neighbourhood hospital. He underwent several examinations and was
                declared ill with dengue fever.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Worse, my father&#39;s Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever or well known as DHF, was acute and
                was treated too late. I, who had been working overtime for two days at the office, regretted everything. I
                could only see Dad lying in his bed and often wincing in pain or unconscious, pale without energy. Mom kept
                crying; she felt even sorry because did not aware of how bad his condition was. She blamed herself for not
                realizing that Dad had DHF.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I could only pray that Dad would get better and Mom could stop blaming herself. She
                just cried beside Dad; she did not even want to go home; she just wanted to be beside him all the
                time.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">November 14th was the worst day of my life. The world seemed to be collapsing. My
                mind was blurred. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I visited my parents at the hospital after returning home to get their clothes. I saw
                Dad was asleep, with Mom just looking at him. Her eyes were tired; her breathing was heavy. She even looked
                skinny. &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t know if that day was the last time I saw them in this world. Even though
                it was sad, I was relieved a little since I could see the strong connection and love between them, which was
                very difficult to describe. Later on, the doctor informed me that my father had died at night. I burst into
                tears; I hugged my father, my dear father, who would start a new Journey without my mom and me. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">My mom was silent. She sat on the floor and covered her face. I hugged her as tight
                as I could. My tears were still there, and I looked at Mom, who stayed still, then suddenly she fell. The
                doctor immediately took care of my mom, took her to the nearest bed and treated her. I was confused half to
                death. My mind started to make its conclusion. I said that it would be the end of my life if she left me
                alone. I prayed for the best that God would not leave me alone. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, not all wishes would be granted. Doctors said my mom had a heart attack and
                was pronounced dead right away. I was speechless. I remember there were a lot of pity stares at me; the
                nurses, doctors, and everyone there. I could not even cry at that time; tears could not come out of these
                eyes. I just froze, silent, staring blurred at the pale legs of the person I loved the most.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Everyone came to our house. Uncle, Aunt, and cousins all came to cheer me up. They
                came with a lot of food or even took me for walks to various places. I went with them only because I
                didn&#39;t feel good about refusing. I joined not even half-heartedly, my heart and I were not there. I was
                silent, not even knowing where I was going, what I ate, what I drank, and who I met. If anyone asks me, what
                have I done, I only remember kissing the graves of the people I love. That&#39;s the only memory I have in
                my life. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since seven months ago, I have been locking myself at home, just staying in my room,
                then daydreaming behind the house, remembering our daily lives in the past where my mom usually hung
                clothes. I left my job and didn&#39;t go to college. Yups, I am off College for all the reasons I lost my
                life goal. The reason I survived. I started to hate the world. I hate everyone, including myself. Why did
                they have to leave me at once?! Why, among many people, should I? Why did God choose me to have this fate?
                Why me ?.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">It&#39;s been seven months. I have been living my life without hope. I lost all my
                dreams at a glance. I don&#39;t have the will to live anymore. I was not even aware of what food I ate,
                whether it was appropriately digested or not, or whether it was healthy. I could only think about the reason
                why God took my parents at a time. I regretted why my parents had to die when I had not given them happiness
                in return for taking care of me. I didn&#39;t cry at all; my tears had run out somewhere. I did not even
                think about the food that I would eat. My friend, Hani, was the one who always delivered her mom&#39;s
                cooking for me. My family suggested that I needed to go to a psychologist, but I refused. I just got angry
                for no reason. They were right, but I feel that I did not need to go that far. What I needed was just to be
                alone .</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">One afternoon after taking a shower, I heard someone knocking on my door. I looked
                ahead and found the figure of a teenage boy carrying a mortar in front and behind his tiny body. I, who had
                never paid attention to something for a long time, suddenly felt pity; he smiled at me while offering his
                wares.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Miss, mortar, miss, It&#39;s cheap, Miss.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I was silent and still watching him. </span></p>
        <p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0">&quot;I have not sold any, Miss. I will give you the original price, without
                profit, Miss. So It would no longer be heavy,&quot;said the little boy. </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How much?&quot; I asked as I awoke from my daydream.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;$5 &nbsp;for a pair.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How much is the profit?&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;$1, Miss.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh God, only $1 for a pcs; he was willing to carry that much
                burden.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I invited him to sit down inside my garage and asked his name,</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You can sit down here!&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said him.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What is your name? </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Adi&quot; </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How old are you?&quot; &quot;You look so young.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I am 15, Miss. Currently, I am studying as a 3rd grade Junior high school
                student.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He said that he is an orphan who has the initiative to trade because he feels
                uncomfortable relying on orphanages and asking for money to cover his needs. I wondered where his parents
                were. Why did he stay in the orphanage? </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">His answer surprised me. He was a child, yet his mind was like an adult. The way he
                thinks was not like the children his age. He was an adult wrapped in a little boy. As he grew up, Adi
                started to feel that he needed to find out about his birth parents. He tried many ways and found out that he
                was a child out of wedlock. He was left at an orphanage because their economy was tough. His parents did not
                have enough money to raise him. &nbsp; </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even Adi told all this without any hatred. He kept smiling at me while drinking the
                tea I had given him earlier. Adi then said he was trying to find out where his parents lived because,
                according to the story he heard, his parents got married when their economy started to improve. Why
                didn&#39;t his parents come back to take him and take care of him to avenge all their sins? Why is Adi even
                now still living in the orphanage? Why?</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Adi says that his parents died after getting married. They died together two years
                ago when they were at home, and until now, it has not been explained what the cause of the death was. Maybe
                it was a heart attack, or someone said that they might be taken a suicide because of the economy, and so on.
                Adi told me that it was harder to know that his parents had died than to know that his parents had abandoned
                him. He said even though they were wrong for leaving him alone, they were the reason for his existence. Even
                though he had such a heavy burden to carry on, he was still happy to exist as Adi. He even blamed himself
                for not finding out about his parents earlier. However, the world still goes on. It could not stop only
                because of him. </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I have to keep fighting,&quot; said him. </span></p>
        <p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0">&quot;There are many kindnesses that I need to repay. Many people have supported
                me to become &nbsp;a successful person.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had to get up. That&#39;s why he always tried his best to support his own life.
                Adi said sadness should not cover the world. The world is not waiting for you; you have to chase it. His
                parents now only need prayers. Adi&#39;s job is only to be a good and pious child so that the reward will be
                abundant for his parents. </span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Once he disappeared from my sight, I entered the house and realized that what I had
                been doing was not right at all!.</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I am beetle headed!&quot; &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I am just wasting my time.&quot; </span></p>
        <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Will mom and dad be happy to see me like this ?&quot; &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">There are still many people I need to help, and there are still many Adi who need
                hugs. I&#39;ve had to get up. This tangled hair needs to be combed, this skinny body needs to be filled, and
                this sad face needs to be replaced.</span></p>
        <p class="c2"><span class="c0">I have to get through this. Why can&#39;t I do it if a small boy like Adi can? In
                reality, my parents provided me with numerous amenities, whereas Adi only met his mother once. Unlike Adi,
                who did not recognize his mother&#39;s smell, Mom and Dad made innumerable sacrifices to keep me alive. I
                felt sorry that I just did something stupid. Starting from now, I will try to be a nice person who does not
                give something up quickly. I&#39;m glad you guys are up there together forever. I promise to always remember
                your sweetness, sincere love with a grin. Thank you for teaching me numerous life lessons. Hope we can meet
                in Jannah.</span></p>
