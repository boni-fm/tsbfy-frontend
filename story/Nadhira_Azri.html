            <p>
                Hey, Eito, what do you think the universe is trying to imply when it decides that we
                shall meet underneath the starry sky?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I still remember the first time I met Eito, as it is one of the brightest memories I
                had in my mind. It is also a moment that I hold really dear in my heart, and I recall it with a fond smile
                more often than I would like to admit.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">It was a beautiful night in April. The sky was clear without any smoke or fog
                apparent insight, twinkling stars decorating the horizon, drawing maps of constellations you can follow with
                your bare eyes, a rare occurrence in a center prefecture like Shinjuku. The faint scent of sakura fills the
                atmosphere with sweetness and warmth; accompanied by the gush of air that playfully blows the pink petals
                from the ground, chills lingering just enough. A perfect day to be spent outside.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I was sitting in a chair in a park, taking a breath to collect my mind after walking
                several blocks to buy new stationeries since I would have my first college opening ceremony the day after. I
                am going to be a freshman at a private university so I was very anxious because I don&rsquo;t want to mess
                anything up. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Huffing, I gaze around the park, and that is when I took notice of four boys playing
                two-on-two volleyball on a nearby court. Interested, I put aside my belongings and watched them with a
                mid-interest. They were all so full of energy, screaming and laughing as if there was no tomorrow.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">After some time, they stopped playing, dropping to the ground with heavy breaths. By
                the look of it, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they will leave anytime soon. Understandable, it is getting pretty
                late. I too had calmed down so I grabbed my tote bag and walked, silently planning what I should eat for
                breakfast tomorrow so that I can still be on time. I think the usual rice and miso soup would be too much so
                maybe cereals will suffice?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; a deep voice stopped my tracks from behind. I turned around
                and was faced with a strong pair of shoulders instead of a direct face. This person is tall TALL, I think
                his height is almost two meters. His height just single-handedly called my non-growing body a midget, sigh.
                Why is he so tall?!</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c6">I blinked then tilted my head upwards. Oh, he is one of the boys from before, looking
                downwards with a friendly gaze. He is handsome and his body proportion is nice to look at, my brain supplied
                unhelpfully. Not gonna lie that spiky but seemingly soft hair is very adorable, also. </span><span
                class="c2">Like a hedgehog.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hedgehog?&rdquo; Crap, did I say that out loud?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Well, I do have pet hedgehogs at home so being called one is a huge
                compliment.&rdquo; He laughed, then grabbed something from his pocket. &ldquo;I just want to return this,
                anyway.&rdquo; He handed me something &ndash; oh my god how can I be so clumsy that I almost lost my student
                id even before I was an official student &ndash; &ldquo;Or well I think this is yours.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Ah, yes! Thank you very much!&rdquo; I took it gratefully, putting it in the
                deepest pit of my wallet and then shrugging it completely in my bag.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;I also go to that college so we may cross paths many times after this.&rdquo;
                A bright smile appears, showing sparkling bunny teeth. Crinkled eyes shining with mirth and friendly joy
                that could put the stars to shame. &ldquo;My name is Eito, nice to meet you.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Something in my universe shifts.</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Just like meteors dancing in space, our fates interlace; a realization I like to
                embrace.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Trying to be more active outside my academic life, I joined the journalism club,
                specifically online article making. The senior that welcomed me and immediately offered to help me in the
                club is a warm and smiley person who told me to call him Shunsuke.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Today, Shunsuke asked me to join him on a duty to give me a quick overview of how the
                club activity is. He told me that he is in charge of the monthly article for the men&#39;s volleyball team,
                which is apparently very strong and famous in the college championships.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&quot;I talked with the manager and she said this interesting person is applying, the
                one we are going to interview today,&rdquo; Shunsuke explained, opening the door of the gymnasium and
                heading straight to a secluded room in the corner, smiling and bowing his head when we passed through some
                of the players sitting on the floor, who greets back with lazy nod and wave. &ldquo;He is the key player of
                his high school&#39;s victory in the Spring Tournament this year, even winning the Most Valuable Player
                award.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&quot;He got many free passes from well-known colleges with reputable volleyball
                teams yet he decided to enroll here because he insists on focusing not only on the sport but his academics
                as well.&quot; He adds, opening his laptop and ushering me to sit beside him. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I nod, interested. He seems like a genuine and hardworking person who already has his
                life together. I am not at that level yet so I might be able to ask for some tips!</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&quot;Apparently even the strongest professional team in our league right now offers
                him a spot.&quot; He gestured to the document, asking me to see. &quot;But since the recent requirement does
                not allow an active student, he refused, saying he wants to pursue his dream as a teacher as
                well.&quot;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I looked at the profile displayed on the screen, skimming through the information
                when the door slid open, making us immediately stand to greet the person arriving. Two people, a girl that
                Shunsuke said is the team manager, and&mdash; Eito?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I&rsquo;m fluttering in my small and quiet milky way, you always come to save
                the day.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Several months have passed. I grew closer with Eito each day since I was practically
                the co-writer for the volleyball team&rsquo;s monthly article with Shunsuke at that point. Shunsuke laughed
                at that, saying that I should be honored to be put in his care. I laughed along, feigning to be touched with
                his kindness.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">It was a sunny Friday evening, the team is going to have their regular practice so I
                came along to take some pictures for documentary purposes. The gymnasium was loud with the boys&rsquo;
                screaming, accompanied by the heavy sound of balls being thrown and shoes scratching the floor. The usual
                lively and bright atmosphere always puts me at ease, a pleasant feeling I&rsquo;ve grown accustomed
                to.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I made a beeline to the spot the freshmen were practicing and immediately found Eito
                sitting on the floor with his back facing me, a bubbly laugh and several high-pitched laughs can be heard
                quite clearly. The others are spreading around, doing their usual drills I have seen countless times.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Eito? You&rsquo;re not practicing?&rdquo; I greeted.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hi! No, not yet.&rdquo; He faced me, greeting back with quirked lips. &ldquo;I
                was assigned to take care of the coach&rsquo;s kids at the moment.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">That&rsquo;s when I noticed two little girls sticking around him, one circling her
                arms around his neck and one gripping his left arm. Wow, Eito is good with kids as well, huh? Folding my
                legs to sit near the group, all of them then looked up at me, wearing the same sunshine smile on their
                faces. Eito pats their arms, &ldquo;Say hello, girls.&rdquo; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Good afternoon!&rdquo; The two kids shouted joyfully. Eito nods in
                satisfaction, proudly ruffling their hair with the softest expression I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and
                I&ndash;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I feel like floating inside the fluffy clouds.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">My constellation has long forgotten how to shine, but Eito, your presence kindles it
                divine.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">It was exactly one year and one month later. We were in our second year. I was still
                sticking around with Shunsuke, working together with him to keep the volleyball website alive and updated.
                Talking about the volleyball team, they were currently busy preparing and practicing for the upcoming Spring
                League. Eito being Eito has glued himself to the practice court more often than not.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Eito was very excited today, he was practically buzzing and bouncing in his seat. A
                reputable alumnus is going to come to visit to give them some motivation and all that jazz. Eito told me
                that he really respected him, saying that he is his main role model and it was a big honor to be able to
                inherit his jersey number, that he wants to be his successor. Not only that, he also declared with fire in
                his eyes that he would surpass him someday.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">We are standing near the door of the hall, Eito is leaning on one wall with his usual
                megawatt smile. I&rsquo;m in front of him, helping Shunsuke set up the camera and microphone. Since the
                senior is a very famous player from the national team, he was asked to document it not only in the article
                but as a video, too.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Soon, the aforementioned senior arrived. He is a tall and broad man who eludes this
                serious but humble and approachable aura around him. I took a peek at Eito and that boy was practically
                beaming. I could imagine a tail wagging behind him, a huge grin appeared on his face. I can&rsquo;t help but
                mirror his expression. Adorable.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">After some time, two freshmen inched close to the door, looking at each other in
                hesitation. I realized that the senior and Eito are blocking the handle and they certainly don&rsquo;t want
                to be disrespectful to just pass through in front. Honestly, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do either.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Eito, bless him, noticed as well. He casts a quick glance, slowly stepping away from
                the door; opening it just enough without breaking the conversation with the senior at all. He gestured to
                them to enter, continuing the discussion in front of the camera easily. Very attentive.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ah, Eito, how can I not adore you if you are like this?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Why say I&#39;m lonely like it&rsquo;s a curse when I have Eito as my
                universe?</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Eito and his extremely lovely behaviors do not stop there. Throughout the three years
                we&rsquo;ve been friends there would always be something that makes him my inspiration even more. One thing
                is his soft spot for animals. Eito has pet hedgehogs for real, just like what he mentioned the first time we
                met. Not one or two, but a whole six member crew, all named after him with just several changes in the last
                syllable, like Eiro, Eina, and Eimu. He always talks about them in the fondest expression you could imagine,
                calling them his babies he loves the most. However, since he was currently living in the sports dormitory,
                he had not been able to see them often, complaining about how much he had missed them.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">This also goes without saying but Eito is the most hardworking person I know. The way
                he could balance his academic life, his passion for volleyball, and his social life at once is beyond my
                imagination. I mean, competing in the national level competitions as a starting player while keeping an
                outstanding GPA and catching up with his relatives? Amazing, really. I could never. Just look at me
                struggling to do my homeworks even though the only thing I do is laying down at my bed. Not something to
                brag about, certainly. Beside that, Eito had even pointed to talk as a key speaker in a freshmen welcoming
                ceremony, proudly sharing his journey; illuminating the world with his light. Chuckling, it has just
                occurred to me that I had actually become Eito&rsquo;s number one supporter. His biggest fan, if you will (I
                can hear Shunsuke snickering and calling me a whipped coward but no, Shunsuke, you don&rsquo;t get it!).
                What I like the most about him is the fact that all his fascinating qualities do not make me feel inferior,
                but rather, inspired; </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Eito is the brightest star that does not burn me, but one that gives me hope and
                aspiration to shine on my own as well.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thank you, my Ursa Major, for helping me find the right path.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">We&rsquo;re now in our last year at university. Eito is still as busy and thriving as
                ever. I had long accepted how amazing Eito is that I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t be unfazed anymore. Yet,
                seeing him hustling and writing his graduate thesis all the while being the vice-captain of the volleyball
                team and our province&rsquo;s representative still makes me sigh in awe, because really, how? Thankfully,
                though, the journalism club does not give the main positions&rsquo; duties and responsibilities for the
                fourth year students because frankly, I did not trust myself enough to be able to manage my time perfectly.
                Shunsuke had also graduated this year, so I do not really hang around in the club as often anymore.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Eito is a stable part of my life I don&rsquo;t want to separate with. He had taught
                me many things, he was also the one teaching me to believe in myself. Everything from finding myself,
                seizing the present, to even planning my future; every single thing I do, I remember how he is always there
                with me, encouraging with his comforting presence. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">We are currently sitting in our usual spot in the library, looking through the open
                window that faces the garden filled with falling sakura petals. Eito has his left palm supporting his head,
                expression soft and relaxed in serenity as he gazes ahead at the pink carpets decorating the whole
                landscape. I look at him for a while more before focusing back on the scenery, smiling.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our graduation ceremony is coming next week, and I will enjoy these precious moments
                with Eito to the fullest.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">The future lies in undefined gravity, but we&rsquo;ll be fine; our glow will always
                align.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">The ceremony had ended many hours ago. After saying the (honestly very dramatic)
                farewells to my friends both in the class and in the journalism club, I stride to the gate, heavily
                preparing myself for what to come after.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Eito is leaning on a wall nearby, perking up when he spots me. Without saying
                anything, he grinned and joined me, walking side by side to the familiar park near the campus that held many
                memories for us. I halted in my step, staring up at the vast and clear sky decorated with twinkling stars,
                beautiful with all the sentiments it carried.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Stars,&rdquo; Eito muttered, blinking slowly. He chuckled, pointing at one
                group of stars forming a constellation that looks abstract but aesthetically pleasing nonetheless.
                &ldquo;Look at that, the two stars nestling together!&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;They were just like us,
                right?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I breathed, smiling. His joy is always contagious to me. &ldquo;Yeah, they really
                do.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;But you know,&rdquo; Eito whispered in a serious tone. &ldquo;Even after tens
                and hundreds of years, I really hope we did not forget about our light and connection just like those stars
                do.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c6">The chilling breeze blew, bringing along the faint sweet scent of sakura. Everything
                is the exact same as our first meeting. Memories flow through my mind, along with the tears that started to
                block my vision. All the cry and laughter we had shared that I cherished. </span><span class="c2">If we were
                really to vanish into the thin air like bubbles, I would be so sad that I could not stop crying.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; Eito mutters, laughing softly. He turns to face
                me, the faint glow of the moon lit him from behind, hugging his figure just right. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we
                will meet again.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">I don&rsquo;t respond, still trying to regain my breath; fighting the blurred light
                and lines that are still consistently hanging in my sight.</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Hey, we promised, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Eito smiles, patting my head, a
                gesture he often does when he senses someone is anxious and in need of some reassurance. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
                going to shine together in the future.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Our eyes met. </span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&ldquo;Until then,&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c0"><span class="c6 c8">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep our stars alight.&rdquo;</span></p>
