            <p>
                Selina was a second-year high school student. Selina
            Dunfort, she was a cheerful student who enjoyed making jokes with her classmates. Not only that, but he was
            a standout student who was always the overall champion. She and her friends were eating lunch in their
            school cafeteria on that day. After selecting from a variety of food and drink choices, they proceeded to a
            seat that was still empty and quiet. Her pals were Elise, Conan, Anne, Robert, Lily, and Selina&rsquo;s
            cousin, Sven.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She felt someone was watching her during their lunch
            since she was still looking for a seat. Finally, Selina dared to stare at her and noticed someone she
            recognized watching her. That person was Gianna, her cousin&#39;s chair mate. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She also gave a small smile because Selina felt she knew
            her, and it would be impolite not to say hello. Selina felt Gianna was still watching her until she and her
            friends finished their lunch. She ignored it and continued walking toward her class with her friends.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The days following, Selina found out that someone was
            watching her every day. Earlier, she found a small razor blade while cleansing the desk drawer wherein she
            was sitting. Selina never brought sharp objects. She has touchy and skinny pores and skin, so she definitely
            avoids sharp items that might doubtlessly injure her. The other day, she observed a paper with bloodstains
            on her desk whilst nobody had come to class as it was still too early. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Is this just my feeling, or is someone playing a
            prank on me, huh?&quot; &nbsp;Selina talked to herself when she felt someone&#39;s prank for the second
            time.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selina didn&#39;t care at first because she thought these
            things were trivial. After the clock showed lunch break, Selina, as usual, went to the cafeteria with five
            of her friends. She chose the food menu and put the food on her tray. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gianna suddenly approached her at the cafeteria table,
            and she looked nervously and scared at her cousin, Sven. Gianna, Selina thought, had looked at her yesterday
            as if she were judging her. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I have something to tell you, Selina.&quot; </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Selina responded with a stutter because she had never spoken to Gianna except for
            academic problems or things that required group work. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s the matter, Gianna? Why do you
            appear to be scared or being pursued by someone?&quot; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gianna turned away and hurried into their class, saying,
            &quot;Sorry, I seem to have forgotten what I intended to say. Next time, Selina!&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Selina looked at Gianna&#39;s departure in confusion. Then Elise also spoke up to
            break the tension that was quite tense because of the expression Gianna gave earlier. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Never mind, maybe Gianna just forgot to say
            something important, and because she forgot, she&#39;s scared of it.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Yeah, that could be it. Let&#39;s finish our food
            because we&#39;re going to class soon.&quot; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sven added Elise&#39;s sentence so that Selina and the others rushed to finish their
            food. In her heart, Selina still felt something nagging because Gianna felt like she was about to say
            something really important, presumably from the gestures she made when she spoke to her.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c1">***</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Starting from that incident, Selina often found that
            Gianna wanted to talk to her every chance. Strangely, every time Gianna seemed to want to approach Selina,
            at that moment, Gianna looked afraid of something. Until one day, Selina caught the look on her pale face
            for a moment when she was about to start a conversation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Guys, have you noticed that Gianna&#39;s been weird
            lately? She often wants to talk to me, but on the other hand, when she&#39;s about to say something, she
            runs away and looks scared. Is my face so scary that it makes her nervous and scared?&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ronan replied with an astonished expression,
            &quot;Yeah, Gianna&#39;s been watching our movements a lot lately, especially Selina. What exactly is she
            trying to say? I&#39;m really curious. I swear.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I think I saw something. Two days ago, I was in the
            school parking lot. I saw Gianni talking to someone with her head down. I clearly remember that it was a
            male posture and voice. However, it was getting late, I ignored them and immediately rushed home. Later, I
            didn&#39;t ever ask Gianni anything because I felt maybe it was a personal thing.&quot; &nbsp;Anne explained
            while looking at her friends who were in front of her.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s suspicious. If I were you, I would
            have asked this to Gianna.&rdquo; Robert interrupted while Anne told him.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selina was even more curious about her friend&#39;s
            story. As for she was planning to follow behind the movements of Gianna. Because she felt that what Gianna
            wanted to tell her was something very important. Starting the next day, Selina carried out her mission to
            follow Gianna secretly. On the first day, she watched Gianna&#39;s movements. She realized that Gianna
            always had lunch in the cafeteria and chose to sit in the direction where her gaze was on Selina. The second
            thing that Selina realized was Gianna always visited the backyard of the school building, waiting for
            someone. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Is Gianna consuming drugs? I think it&#39;s
            currently booming among school students like me, but is Gianna like that? Gosh! I&#39;m getting more and
            more curious about that!&quot; Selina said while still observing Gianna, who was still waiting for
            someone.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Selina, what are you doing here?&rdquo; A voice that Selina believed was her
            cousin, Sven, startled her, who was hiding.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;God! Sven, for real.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What is it? Are you stalking a boy?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sssstttt! Please lower your voice. I was watching Gianna.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What was that for?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lately, Gianna always looks like she wants to talk to me, but she never says a
            word to me, and that makes me very curious. As a result, I plan to follow her so I can get a clue as to why
            she&#39;s acting weird like that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Oh my God, Selina. We&#39;d better go home right now. Come on,
            quickly!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Why? Is something wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Suddenly, from the direction where Gianna was standing, Selina saw Gianna screaming
            for mercy because she was being stabbed by someone she knew very well, Robert. Robert repeatedly stabbed the
            knife at Gianna without making any expression. He turned his head towards Selina and Sven.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you guys want to feel it too? Alright, get ready because you guys are the
            next target,&rdquo; said Robert, grinning at the two of them.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Robert took his knife on Gianna&#39;s drooping body and was about to attack them
            both. Selina and Sven turned around and ran as fast as they could. Selina&#39;s whole body shook, and her
            legs felt weak, and she wanted to cry. Meanwhile, Sven gripped Selina&#39;s hand tightly while pulled her
            hand tightly. But, somehow, Robert ran. He was able to catch up with Selina and Sven, and push them to the
            corner of the yard that would lead to the school classes.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t run anymore, Selina, Sven.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;ROBERT, WAIT. WHY IN THE WORLD ARE YOU DOING THIS?&rdquo; Selina asked
            Robert.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You never knew what was going to happen, Selina. On a sunny day, it is not
            impossible that, ten minutes later, rain started to pour. That&rsquo;s why you must get your
            umbrella.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the knife was about to hit Selina and Sven, Selina felt sucked into another
            dimension and spun like she was in a car that fell into a cliff. Selina screamed until she heard her alarm.
        </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Beep-beep-beep&rsquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Selina jumped from her bed with tired looks and pale face, cold sweat dripping from
            her forehead.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;For God&#39;s Sake, what is that?!&rdquo; Selina was very shocked about the
            unexpected dream.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c6">&ldquo;Lina!!! Wake up, please, honey. Sven is waiting for you below.&rdquo; Selina
            heard her mother&#39;s voice from the dining room.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selina took a bath in a hurry because the school gate was
            about to be closed in thirty minutes. After that, she went to school with Sven.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Sven.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes? What happened, Selina? You look like a zombie because of your
            appearance.&rdquo; Sven giggled to his cousin.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I think I dreamed about something scary.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Selina tells Sven about the dream to Sven from the start when Gianna looks suspicious
            and wants to talk about something, but she seems afraid. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Selina, what if Robert is there with me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sven seemed to hold a knife in his hand and grin at her.</span></p>
