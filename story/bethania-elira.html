                                    reason of her retirement due to the lack of explanation she gave on the press
                                    conference she held a week
                                    after Paris Fashion Week.</span></p>

                                    once she decide something for herself, she will never regret it or change the
                                    decision she has made. The
                                    atmosphere in the hall was very quiet, there&rsquo;s only the sound of
                                    journalists&#39; laptop keyboard
                                    clicks and the sound of camera shots from reporters and reporters could be heard.
                                    Arriving at the hall, Jane
                                    walked to her seat and took a deep breath before starting her speech. After a few
                                    minutes of silence, Jane
                                    breaking the silence by confidently started the speech.</span></p>
                            <p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I had such an amazing times growing up in the

                                    sweet, and tears in every way

                                    me. However, after a lot
                                    of consideration and contemplation I had, I decided to retire from being a model and
                                    continue my life in
                                    another path I chose. I apologize for this sudden announcement I made and thank you

                                    speculating on the actual reasons. A scandal even emerges to a surface, love affair

                                    athlete, Greg Ashton. An unknown stranger uploaded a blurry pic of Jane and Greg on

                                    television right away. She
                                    opens the door to her balcony and sit on her favorite chair. There are 2 chairs she
                                    puts in her balcony. She
                                    sits while giving an empty gaze to the empty chair next to her. She suddenly has no
                                    thoughts and shocked by
                                    the strange thing she sees in that chair. It is a small jewelry box. She takes that
                                    box and opens it, there
                                    is a necklace with a little lock pendant, and a neatly folded letter. She gently
                                    opens the letter and read
                                    it. There is only one sentence written in that small letter, </span><span

                                    to streaming down from
                                    her eyes. Every memories she had that she painstakingly buried suddenly raged in her

                                    the bittersweet past she had.</span></p>

                                    asked Greg</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Jane</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first conversation Jane had with Greg suddenly haunts
                                    Jane&rsquo;s mind. Both
                                    Greg and Jane met when they were at the lowest point in their life. Jane was in
                                    front of the convenience
                                    store, waiting for her mother who promised to spend new year eve together with Jane,
                                    but even until the year
                                    changed, she didn&rsquo;t show up. Jane is a brokenhome daughter who lives with her
                                    grandmother, her father
                                    died when she was still 5 and her mother is always busy with her business. Greg was
                                    drunk on their first
                                    meeting, he was drinking alone after being suspended from his basketball team due to
                                    his low performance at
                                    that time which made his team kept on losing.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jane was only 18 and Greg was only 20 when they first met.
                                    They barely have friends
                                    at that time which made them can only leaned on each other and being each
                                    other&rsquo;s support system. They
                                    had every painful and joyful moments in their life shared with each other. They
                                    always accompany each other
                                    for years they spent when they are working hard to achieve each others&rsquo;
                                    dreams. After years being each
                                    other&rsquo;s support system and slowly achieving more in the process of reaching
                                    their dreams, a lot of
                                    unexpected things happened.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After long time knowing and always being on each
                                    other&rsquo;s side, when Jane was 22
                                    and Greg 24 years old, they decided to date. One year of their relationship was
                                    beautiful, they rarely fight
                                    and argue, even when they have a little fight, it won&rsquo;t lasts more than a day.
                                    But sometimes life
                                    doesn&#39;t always go according to our plans. At the age of 25, Greg was recruited
                                    to be the part of
                                    International Basketball Team which made him must have training and live in United
                                    States. He must leave
                                    Jane in Singapore alone. Both of them were totally fine with a long distance
                                    relationship. They believe
                                    distance is not a big deal for their relationship as they&rsquo;ve been through more
                                    complicated things
                                    before.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">But everything can change, so does human. Greg had a hard
                                    time during his training in
                                    U.S, that is the hardest training he has done in his life. It&rsquo;s not only about
                                    the practice and
                                    exercise to become the part of International Basketball Team but the seniority and
                                    racism are also extreme
                                    especially to the Asian people. Greg as a newbie and an Asian as well have to face
                                    many difficulties with
                                    the seniors, they often ask him to lend them money, force him to fulfil their favor,
                                    and many other
                                    ridiculous things.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, Greg thought he can&rsquo;t tell those struggle he
                                    had there to Jane since
                                    he didn&rsquo;t want her to worry about him when he clearly knew she also have to
                                    face a lot of difficulties
                                    on her career. But Greg didn&rsquo;t realize that he didn&rsquo;t being honest to
                                    Jane is actually a bad
                                    thing for their relationship. Unwittingly, he rarely contacts Jane, and even when
                                    Jane tried to contact him
                                    first, he often didn&rsquo;t answer the call nor reply the message from Jane. Both
                                    of them were having a
                                    hard time due to the lack of communication.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jane, a person who always makes a quick decision, thought if
                                    maybe their relationship
                                    just can&rsquo;t work anymore. Greg who keeps on having a tougher time in the U.S
                                    thought that he will just
                                    gonna tell Jane everything after a year when his training is done and can meet Jane
                                    in person.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a year has passed, Greg came back to Singapore and her
                                    first destination is
                                    Jane&rsquo;s place. When he arrived, she&rsquo;s not around. Because it is still
                                    awkward between them, Greg
                                    called her manager about Jane. That is the moment where he realized, everything is
                                    already messed up because
                                    of him. He didn&rsquo;t even know Jane was in Paris at that time for her debut on
                                    Paris Fashion Week. He
                                    cried realizing how hard it must be for Jane during this past one year. Later on
                                    Greg decided to flew to
                                    Paris hoping he can fix their relationship. When he left, Greg didn&rsquo;t realize
                                    that he left the gift he
                                    wanted to give to Jane in the chair on Jane&rsquo;s apartment balcony. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c5">Upon his arrival in Jane&rsquo;s place in Paris, the
                                    atmosphere is extremely awkward
                                    between both of them.</span><span class="c4">&ldquo;H-how did you know I&rsquo;m in
                                    Paris and specifically
                                    in this hotel?&rdquo;, </span><span class="c5">said Jane in a slightly angry tone.
                                    Then she looked at her
                                    manager next to her who looking down with worried face and she just knew right away
                                    what happened. Greg
                                    walked up to jane and hugged her tightly while whispering to her ear, </span><span
                                    class="c4">&ldquo;I miss
                                    you and I&rsquo;m sorry, Jane&rdquo;</span><span class="c5">. Jane, who was already
                                    disappointed with
                                    Greg&#39;s behavior the past year, slowly let go of Greg&#39;s hug. </span><span
                                    class="c4">&ldquo;I have to
                                    go, let&rsquo;s talk about that later&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">said Jane in a
                                    calm tone.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jane was actually wanted to travel around Paris the time when
                                    Greg came, but she
                                    decided to just left Paris that day and flew back to Singapore. This time
                                    Jane&rsquo;s manager can&rsquo;t
                                    tell anything to Greg anymore. Greg can&rsquo;t find any information about Jane
                                    anymore so he decided to
                                    left Paris as well.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c5">As soon as Greg arrived in Paris, he straight up went to
                                    Jane&rsquo;s place. He saw
                                    Jane cries her balcony while hugging herself. Jane who realized Greg came, suddenly
                                    feel the urge to let her
                                    emotion out that time. She asked him bitterly, </span><span class="c4">&ldquo;Oh I
                                    thought you forget that I
                                    exist, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span><span class="c5">, Greg answered in a calm
                                    voice, </span><span class="c4">&ldquo;Jane please let me explain it first,&rdquo;,
                                </span><span class="c5">Jane laugh like
                                    disdain then said, </span><span class="c4">&ldquo;Explain it? What exactly do you
                                    want to explain? You found
                                    another girl there? You living your best life there so you don&rsquo;t even time to
                                    call me or even text
                                    me?&rdquo;. </span><span class="c0">Right when she said it, Greg can&rsquo;t help
                                    but tell everything to her
                                    in an angry and sad tone. Unfortunately, those honesty from Greg just makes
                                    everything become worse, it just
                                    makes Jane becomes more convinced of the decision she made, which is to end their
                                    relationship. She does
                                    think it is not the distance that ruined their relationship but she had this feeling
                                    from the time Greg hard
                                    to communicate that Greg is not the same anymore. Back then everytime Greg having a
                                    hard time, he always
                                    tell Jane about anything, he shares the burden he felt to Jane but when he is happy,
                                    he also share it with
                                    Jane. Jane thinks it will not be the same anymore if Greg&rsquo;s mindset of their
                                    relationship has
                                    changed.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;What makes you think it is right to tell me now and
                                    not the time when it
                                    becomes a burden to you? Greg I&rsquo;m sorry but it just convince me that I
                                    don&rsquo;t have to spend more
                                    time to contemplating about our relationship, it just won&rsquo;t work out between
                                    you and me anymore.
                                    Before you always share everything with me, both your hard times and good times. But
                                    now, you only want to
                                    share the good times with me, and I don&rsquo;t want it Jack. I don&rsquo;t want
                                    that kind of relationship
                                    between us,&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">said Jane.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jane&#39;s words make Greg speechless. Greg knows what kind
                                    of person Jane is that
                                    once she made a decision for her life, she won&rsquo;t regret it or take her words
                                    back. </span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Greg left her without saying anything on that day. After Greg
                                    left, Jane cried non
                                    stop. She doesn&rsquo;t believe it really has to end up like that. There&rsquo;s
                                    also one thing that she has
                                    been contemplate about since their relationship started to fell apart, her
                                    relationship with Greg is
                                    different, it is more than just a &lsquo;lovey dovey&rsquo; relationship, it&rsquo;s
                                    all about the process
                                    of her pursuing her dreams and becomes a famous model she is right now. She almost
                                    give up on her dreams and
                                    on her life when she met him. But meeting him felt like starting a new life for
                                    Jane. Separating with him
                                    felt like her whole world falling apart. Jane decided to started a completely new
                                    life again and left
                                    everything behind, including her dream job as a model.</span></p>

                            <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unwittingly, she lets herself walk in the street while
                                    holding that little box from
                                    Greg. She keeps on walking until the rain start falling and she realized she&rsquo;s
                                    already in the front of
                                    the convenience store, the place where she and Greg first met. Suddenly tears
                                    streaming down on her face.
                                    For the first time in her life she feels like she has made a wrong decision. For the
                                    first time in her life
                                    she wishes she could go back to the time she end it all with Greg and take back
