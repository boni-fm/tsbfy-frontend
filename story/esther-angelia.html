                            <p class="c6"><span class="c0 c3 c2">Long ago, deep in the woods under the moonlight, a girl
                                    laid down on the grass,
                                    staring at the sparkling diamond up in the sky.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3 c2"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c0 c3 c2">&ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; She called the woman beside her
                                    with a very soft voice.
                                    &ldquo;I still feel cold. Should we find more wood to throw into the fire?&rdquo;
                                    She asked her mother. The
                                    woman stared at the young girl, got close to her then pulled her into a warm
                                    embrace.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3 c2"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c0 c3 c2">&ldquo;Still feel cold?&rdquo;</span></p>

                                    shook her head and
                                    snuggled to find comfort. A smile was carved on both of their faces. The mother
                                    caressed the hair of her
                                    daughter. </span></p>

                            <p class="c6"><span class="c0 c3 c2">Josselyn chuckled a bit with her eyes closed. She
                                    hugged her mother, feeling
                                    her body calm till she fell asleep on such a tranquil night along with her
                                    mother&#39;s lullaby. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2 c3"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c0 c2">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t leave you alone in this cold world,
                                    Josselyn.&rdquo; She
                                    whispered, then kissed her forehead, gently caressed the hair of her precious one,
                                    closed her eyes, and
                                    finally fell asleep.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>

                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">The sun was already rising, and so were both of the
                                    Yuan-tis too. Half-Yuan-ti, to
                                    be more specific. Snake-like eyes and scales on some parts of their body. They were
                                    not human, even though
                                    they looked human. They covered their body with a cloak to disguise so that others,
                                    the normal humans, would
                                    not get scared by their appearances.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Ready for the journey, snakelet?&rdquo; Josselyn
                                    brought a pocket knife,
                                    nodding to show that she was ready. Her mother smiled, tilting her head in the
                                    direction of their
                                    heading.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Go lead the way, would ya?&rdquo;</span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">A bit of hesitation came to the young one, but she wiped
                                    it out. Josselyn promised
                                    her mother to learn about the map so that, when she grows up, she will not depend on
                                    her mother to read a
                                    map. Her mother chuckled seeing her spawn&rsquo;s eyes fixed on the map, trying hard
                                    to comprehend the
                                    symbols, tracks, and the mark. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m trying my best, okay? Don&rsquo;t make
                                    me nervous!&rdquo;
                                    wrinkles on her forehead, and murmured each of the symbols&rsquo; meaning to find
                                    the track to the next
                                    stop. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Gotcha! We go to the south, and then, after we
                                    arrive at Verde Lake.
                                    We&hellip; uh&hellip; go to the northeast of the lake?&rdquo; </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c0">She looked up to her mother, stared as if she was asking her
                                    mother&rsquo;s avowal.
                                    Her mother got close to her and looked at the map that she was holding, </span><span
                                    class="c0">made</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;her more nervous. Her mother tried
                                    to hold her laugh while
                                    seeing her spawn back and fixed her eyes on the map to make sure of the
                                    interpretation she told. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;What are you murmuring there? Casting a
                                    spell?&rdquo; Her mother
                                    chuckled</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;The map won&rsquo;t fly to lead us, Snakelet! To
                                    the south,

                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Really?! Yes! I did it! Uh-uhm..&rdquo; she cut her
                                    excitement and faked
                                    her throat-clearing noises as she saw her mother about to make fun of her.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>

                                    this way!&rdquo; her
                                    mother ruffled the spawn&rsquo;s hair as she followed her steps back into their
                                    journey.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;&ndash;</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">It was approximately 5 hours since they left their
                                    temporary camp. They finally
                                    stepped foot at the first stop, The Veder Lake.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rest our feet a bit? Shall we?&rdquo; She
                                    approached her mother,
                                    who was already sitting under the big tree by the lake. She sat right beside her
                                    mother, brought the map to
                                    her, and asked several questions that she might have already asked before. The
                                    triangle symbol, the highland
                                    and lowland symbol, the wavy thing, the </span><span class="c0">color</span><span
                                    class="c1 c0">&nbsp;of
                                    red, yellow, light green, dark green, and many more. Also, the mark that her mother
                                    made on the map.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Will this thing bring us to father?&rdquo;</span>

                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Her mother shrugged. A smile and chuckle did not sound
                                    happy but not sad, just
                                    flat.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>

                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Josselyn smiled widely. She continued excitedly reading
                                    the map, trying to

                                    way. Quickly Josselyn hid the map inside her bag. One of them confronted Josselyn as
                                    she put the map in her
                                    bag.</span></p>

                                    a smirk. He seemed to
                                    be the leader of the other two. He glanced at Josselyn&rsquo;s bag, then looked back
                                    to the other two,
                                    signaling them to surround the Yuan-tis.</span></p>

                                    to them, startled her mother too, because she never heard her own daughter confront
                                    people before. </span>

                                    she continued.</span>

                                    into laughter. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>

                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">As her mother commanded her, Josselyn managed to dodge the
                                    sudden attack. Her
                                    mother kicked one of them on the stomach. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Mother, behind you!&rdquo; Her mother turned,
                                    smacked the other one who
                                    tried to stab her with a knife. The leader quickly approached Josselyn to get her
                                    bag. She hugged her bag
                                    and ran around the chaos, not letting the three of them take her bag. </span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">After leaved bruises and knocked-out the other two, her
                                    mother pulled out a smoke
                                    bomb made by a handful of dust from the firewoods that was put in a patchwork, tied
                                    with a thread. She
                                    pulled Josselyn and threw the smoke bomb toward them. They ran away as fast as they
                                    could without knowing
                                    where they were heading.</span></p>

                                    rested under a big old tree
                                    near a village. The village seemed to be a peaceful place for them to rest, so they
                                    chose to camp outside.
                                    They opened their cloak and rid it of dust. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>

                                    humans- played around,
                                    some adults came back from the farm as the sky turned orange, and some elderly sat
                                    in front of their house
                                    with their grandchild. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">They seemed nice. That was what Josselyn thought.</span>

                                    came to her senses and
                                    nodded. She observed her surroundings to find any sticks from the tree to make a
                                    campfire. Her mother stayed
                                    in the temporary campsite they built while preparing the dinner for them to
                                    eat.</span></p>

                                    started rising. Both of them shared their thoughts and feelings for what happened
                                    today. Josselyn tripped on
                                    her own cloak while she was busy reading the map, recalled the lame jokes her mother
                                    made, met the raiders,
                                    confronted them, and again managed to survive another day as a half yuan-ti.</span>

                                    knows where. Both of them finished their dinner and prepared themselves for
                                    tomorrows&rsquo; journey. Read
                                    the map to track the tracks. They did not know the chaos that would come to

                            </p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>

                                    ALL!&rdquo; She shouted to
                                    the mass. It went silent for a sec. Their faces still look not happy nor convinced
                                    by her statement. </span>

                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Once a monster, Stay. A. Monster.&rdquo; One of
                                    them confronted her and
                                    said it with emphasis on each word. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>

                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">A second after that, her mother got ambushed by the mass.
                                    Josselyn was shocked.
                                    She witnessed how brutal the mass was. She held her breath. Her body was trembling.
                                    Unfortunately when she
                                    stepped back, she accidentally stepped on a stick that made a crack. Thus, some of
                                    the villagers saw her and
                                    yelled at her. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;She got a spawn!&rdquo;</span></p>

                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">Josselyn saw the helpless body of her mother, being kicked
                                    and stabbed by them.
                                    Their eyes met in the middle of the chaos.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Run...&quot; More or less, that was what Josselyn
                                    got by reading her
                                    mother&rsquo;s lips. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think you can get away, monster!&rdquo;
                                    One of them said, and
                                    almost half of the mass turned to Josselyn. Panicked by the ambush that turning to
                                    her, she ran away as her
                                    mother said. While she was running, her eyes observed the woods, tried to find a way
                                    to escape from the
                                    mass. </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">&quot;Gotcha!&quot; She found a cave located between two
                                    different paths to hide
                                    inside. She curled herself hoping the mass had no idea to find her here. She holds
                                    her breath and cries. She
                                    tried not to make any sounds that could trigger the mass. Hurt all over her body.
                                    Her head felt dizzy, and
                                    her foot felt sore. Even she can hear how fast her heartbeat is. As she thought that
                                    the mass had already
                                    passed the cave, she slowly took a deep breath, breathed in, and breathed out slowly
                                    to calm herself.
                                </span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>

                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">In the middle of the night in the woods, the light remains
                                    from the moon only. She
                                    walked out of the cave, walked down slowly, sobbed, and hugged herself. Cold. She is
                                    confused, digesting
                                    what she just witnessed and what happened to her. Feels unreal.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">She walked back to the campsite she was about to rest and
                                    where she witnessed the
                                    cruelty. There lay her mother. Helpless, bruised, and some of her skin burned. She
                                    grabbed her bag and some
                                    of the stuff from his mother&rsquo;s bag.</span></p>
                            <p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p>
                            <p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0">She stared at the soulless body with sorrow. She caressed
                                    the hair of her mother,
                                    and a drop of tears fell from the young Yuan-tis eyes. It happened too quickly, and
                                    the fact that she
                                    couldn&rsquo;t do anything to help made her feel guilty.</span></p>
