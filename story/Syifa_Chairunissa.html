            <p>
                Glancing at the brand new watch on her wrist, it already says seven thirty two
                P.M. Yet she is still sitting on the chair inside this place, facing the only computer here.
                Inhaling deeply, she could smell the freshness left from today&rsquo;s stock still dancing in
                the air. She smiled as her left hand tucked the hair behind her ear and started to make some
                notes. In her head, she remembered buying this small building two years ago right after she
                graduated from college. She knows it sounds crazy to start a business without many friends
                beside her, but with some help from her very supportive childhood friend, she made this place
                into a small flower shop. This childhood friend of hers loves to give a hand here every weekend
                just like what he did today. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey,&quot; someone said while she heard the footsteps approaching her
                slowly.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hi,&quot; She dropped her pen as she shot her head up to see her childhood
                friend. &quot;Wait, I thought you were home already?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah, I was,&quot; he walked and stopped in front of the desk, next to some
                lilies and tulips.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Then.. what are you doing here?&quot; Furrowing her eyebrows as she
                observes him carefully. She can feel her heart beating a little bit faster.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;To give you this&quot; and then he dropped a paper bag containing a box
                inside it on the desk, she leaned her body to see what&rsquo;s inside immediately.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What is that?&quot; She looks nervous when she touches the paper bag. But
                then she takes it anyway. Her childhood friend giggled at her response.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh come on. Do you really think I&#39;m capable of giving you something
                awful?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, you do like to make fun of me sometimes, so of course you are capable
                of giving me something awful just to see me miserable&quot; she stops examining the paperbag and
                stares at him.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ouch. I&#39;m not that evil. And I only make fun of you because I love you,
                Daisy&quot; he laughed and hit her shoulder playfully to try to make it sound like a
                joke.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The truth is, he really does. And not the kind of love he gives to his other
                friends, like he always said to them all this time.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">She doesn&#39;t respond to what he says. Instead, she pulls out the box that has
                been inside the paper bag.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What is this?&quot; She looks at him.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">He rolled his eyes, &quot;Can&#39;t you just open it and figure it out by
                yourself? Come on, I promise that one is not a joke&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c7">She pouts at his reply but proceeds to open the box anyway. She seems stunned
                when she finally figures out what&#39;s inside the box. There are 7 cupcakes with a note at the
                top of the box, saying </span><span class="c5">&#39;Happy Birthday, Daisy
                Cooper&#39;</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Happy birthday, Daisy. I know you think I ain&rsquo;t care that much about
                you, but I do&quot; He tries to keep his voice as steady as possible. &quot;I hope you
                like..&quot; He couldn&#39;t finish his sentence because she gave him a tight hug.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Thank you so much&quot; is all she said. He hugged her back and buried his
                face on her shoulder. He can feel her shuddering and start to sniffle.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Heeey. Please don&#39;t cry. You&#39;re supposed to be happy. It&#39;s your
                day!&quot; He let go of her hug and wiped the tears on her face. He holds her hand and
                smiles.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No. You don&#39;t know how much that means to me. No one&#39;s ever
                really.. I never..&quot; she looks down, unable to finish her sentence.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Is that why you stay here until this late?&quot; He holds her chin up so
                she can look at him.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">She nods. &quot;I just don&#39;t want to be alone on my apartment and realizing
                how lonely I am&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You could&#39;ve called me, you know&quot; He tries to lighten up her mood,
                while actually his heart hurts to see her this sad. And thinking about how lonely she feels on
                her special day? She doesn&#39;t deserve that. She deserves all the happiness in the world! If
                only she knew how desperate he is to try to give her that happiness.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I was just afraid I might bother you. I thought you were on a
                date?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No, that was just an excuse because I had to go home early and bake you
                these&quot; He pointed at the box.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You baked these?&quot; She takes the box and observes the cupcake one by
                one.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You doubt my baking skill? Go on try it&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">She takes one cupcake and gives it a bite. Her eyes light up as she tastes
                it.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Told you&quot; He smiled with pride.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I didn&#39;t know you can bake?&quot; she giggles.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot; He rolled his eyes. &quot;There are a lot of
                things you don&#39;t know about me, Daice&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh yeah? What else that I don&#39;t know about you?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Let me see&quot; He pauses and watches her finish that one cupcake. She
                looks like a little kid. But he&rsquo;s happy to see her that happy. Ever since he met her, it
                was clear that she had been through a lot of things, and he can see how much her past is eating
                her slowly day by day. He tries his best to take every opportunity to make her at least look a
                little alive. Even though it only lasts for a few minutes. &quot;I never actually go on those
                dates that I told you about&quot; He lowered his voice down and looked at the floor.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I knew that already&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What? How so?&quot; He looks back at her and furrows his eyebrows.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, you always have those twitches on the corner of your eyes when you
                lie.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sighs. She is that good at reading people. Well, she does not have many
                friends. He shouldn&#39;t be surprised.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I hate how easy you can read me&quot; He pouted.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, that is the only easy part. The rest is not really&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh? I thought you knew everything?&quot; He let out a chuckle.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You.. you just.. unpredictable, Joe&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Is she... blushing? Even in the dim light of the Petal Paradise he can see her
                cheeks are turning into a slight pink.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, I still win then&quot; He grinned.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Fine. You are&quot; she smiles widely at him. His favorite smile of all
                people on this entire planet. The only smile that can warm his heart, and convince him that the
                world is not a scary place.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only smile that makes him fall so hard for her.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, there&#39;s another thing...&quot; He said hesitantly.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What other thing?&quot; She looks at him curiously.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That you don&#39;t know about me&quot; He&rsquo;s contemplating whether he
                should go tell this one to her or not.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh? Okay what is it?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Shit, okay there&#39;s no turning back now, isn&#39;t it? What else can he tell
                her that she hasn&#39;t known about him yet? Even with the previous fact, she can already guess
                it perfectly. He can&#39;t make up other stories because she would know that he&rsquo;s about to
                lie again.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">He means, he has been dying to tell her about this anyway. No matter what will
                happen, at least he has to tell her. Because he may never have the same opportunity
                anymore.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">He take a deep breath before he shut his eyes and say &quot;the I love you thing
                was not a joke&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">He said that as quickly as possible. But there&#39;s only silence. He doesn&#39;t
                dare to open his eyes, because he can feel her staring deep at him.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;W... what?&quot; After a few seconds that feels like eternity, she finally
                speaks with a really low voice, almost like a whisper.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;God damn it, Daisy,&quot; He chuckled nervously. &quot;I was never joking
                when I said I love you&quot; with all the courage he has left, he opens his eyes to stare back
                at her. &quot;Ever since I met you. You helped me...&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hold your kite for it to fly just like any other kids&rsquo; kite? Yeah, I
                do remember. But.. how?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">He shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know. You never really know when and how you fall
                in love with someone, right? You just.. did. And also the fact that you were always there for
                me. Even when I screwed up, or... having some existential crisis. Or whenever I feel like I want
                to just give up. You might never realized it, but you&#39;ve done so much to me and that is what
                makes me fall even deeper for you&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">She seems hesitant. &quot;But.. I.. I&#39;m not as good as you think I
                am..&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c7">&quot;Daisy&quot; He cut her off because he knows that she&#39;s about to start
                the whole </span><span class="c5">I don&#39;t deserve you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;thing.
                Because he knows that&#39;s what she&#39;s always doing. Thinking that she doesn&#39;t deserve
                to be loved, to be happy. &quot;If you want to reject me please find a better excuse. I mean
                come on. That&#39;s lame. You don&#39;t have to say anything back. I was just letting you know
                something about me that you don&#39;t know, remember?&quot; He tries to let out a laugh to stop
                himself from crying.</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Who said I want to reject you?&quot; She takes his hands, and then tilt her
                head so she can look at him. &quot;I never thought that you would feel that way to me because
                it&#39;s just impossible for a guy like you to fall for a girl like me. You&#39;re like a dream
                that could never be real.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">He places his hand on her cheek and caresses it with his thumb. He leans his body
                in slowly and hugs her. He can hear her heart beating so fast as he closes his eyes and inhales
                her sweet scent. It feels like the world has stopped moving and the time stands still. He wants
                this moment to last forever. Just him and his childhood friend. </span></p>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c0">She immediately returned the hug and wrapped her hands around his neck.
                &quot;This is the best birthday I&#39;ve ever had, and you&#39;re the best gift I&#39;ve ever
                got in my life&quot;</span></p>
